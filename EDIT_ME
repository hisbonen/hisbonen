* Identifying verbs:
Identifying a verb in Hebrew or Aramaic entails discerning several important pieces of information. For example, let’s identify the verb “מאכיל.”
===
> [[2|Okay]]
===

2: Every Hebrew and Aramaic verb comes from a shoresh or root. [[Shoresh|<small>(more)</small>]]
A root is a short series of letters that produces a family of related words. For example: 
| *Shoresh* | * Meaning* |
| אכל | Eating |
| הלך | Walking / travel |
| אמר | Speech |
We identify the root of a word by finding which letters are not part of suffixes or prefixes.
Looking at our word מאכיל, we can identify the shoresh אכל, which is used to produce words related to the concept of “eating.”
===
> [[3|Okay]]
===

3: Every Hebrew and Aramaic verb has what’s called a “binyan.” [[Binyan|<small>(more)</small>]]
A binyan is a theme of meaning that is combined with a shoresh to produce a verb family.
For example, you might have a binyan whose theme is “causative,” i.e. it produces verbs where an actor causes another thing to do a given action.
Putting the shoresh אכל into a “causative” binyan might produce the verb לְהָכִיל, _lehachil_, “to feed” (i.e, to _cause_ someone else to eat.)
Every binyan has a special pattern of spelling and pronunciation that allows us to identify words in that binyan.
===
> [[4|Okay]]
===

4: Every verb has what’s called a tense. [[Tenses of Hebrew and Aramaic|<small>(more)</small>]]
For example, taking our verb מאכיל, we might know that the spelling indicates a verb that is in the “active participle” tense, which indicates an ongoing or habitual action, i.e “feeds” or “is feeding,” as opposed to “fed” or “will feed.”
===
> [[5|Okay]]
===

5: Every verb has what’s called “person” and “number.” This tells you how many people are doing the action, and whether they are masculine or feminine. Our example of מאכיל is masculine singular, indicating a single male doer.
===
> [[6|Okay]]
===

6: For every combination of a binyan and a tense, there will be a table of conjugations for every person. For example, these are the conjugations for [[Hifil Active Participle for Regular Shorushim|the Hebrew causative binyan put in the active participle]].

* Tense:
A tense is a form of a verb that has a specific time-period or function.
- A verb in Hebrew or Aramaic has a [[shoresh]], [[binyan]], and [[tense]].
- These are the [[Tenses of Hebrew and Aramaic]]
- Here, we call all verb permutations “tenses,” but you may hear others distinguish between tenses and “moods.”


* Verb forms beginning with ה:
There are several verb forms in Hebrew that begin with a ה prefix:
- The [[{hifil past tense} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., הִבְדִּיל, _hivdil,_ “he separated.”)
- The [[{hifil imperative} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., הַבְדֵּל, _havdeil,_ “separate!”)
There are no major forms in Aramaic that begin with ה because the Aramaic equivalent of the hifil ie [[afel]] begins with א instead.


* Verb forms beginning with מ:
There are [[several {{Hebrew verb forms beginning with מ}}]], and [[several {{Aramaic verb forms beginning with מ}}]].


* Vowel shift for ח and ע: When ח or ע are present after a vowel sound like “ei,” or “oo,” sometimes a second vowel sound “ah” is added.
- For example, the [[_pa’al_ active participle for regular shorushim]] has an “ei” vowel sound, eg כּוֹתֵב (_koseiv_, he is writing.) However, the [[pa’al active participle for shorushim ending with ח or ע]] has two vowel sounds, eg פּוֹתֵחַ (_posei-ach_, he is opening.)
- Some linguists bring this as [[evidence for the shift of the pronunciation of these letters]].

Evidence for the shift of the pronunciation of these letters:
Some linguists bring vowel changes for shorushim ending in ח or ע as evidence for a shift in their pronunciation:
- We generally pronounce ח like we do כ, and ע like we do א.
- However, some linguists point to the fact that “gutteral” letters like ח or ע receive an “extra” vowel sound (_po-say-ach_ as opposed to, e.g. _kos-eiv)_ as evidence that the original sounds of ח and ע were different from כ and א.
- The real sound for a ח or ע might have been so low in the throat, that the jaw would need to open fully to pronounce them, causing the vowel shift from “ei” to “ah.”
- This is as opposed to the כ or א letters which are similar to ח and ע but which are pronounced at the back of the mouth, without opening the throat, and can therefore accomidate an “ei” vowel, eg הוֹלֵךְ (_holeich_, [he] is walking), or בּוֹרֵא (_borei_, [he] is creating, not requiring _hole-a-ch_ or _borei-ach_)
===

* Word-order in Hebrew and Aramaic:
Hebrew and Aramaic have different word-order rules than English:
- In English, you almost always have a subject, then a verb, then an object, eg “The man eats the apple.”
- In Hebrew and Aramaic, these rules are more flexible.
- The existence of the direct object marker את allows the object to precede the subject more easily than in English.
- E.g, את התפוח אוכל האיש, “the apple, the man eats” is perfectly valid Hebrew but is awkward in English.
- Keep a heads up when reading Rishonim like Rashi and Tosofos that sentences frequently begin with a verb or object rather than the subject.


[Dikduk/Aramaic]

* Aramaic definite article:
Aramaic has something called a [[definite article]].
Definite articles are added to nouns to indicate the thing is already known to the reader.
In Aramaic, the definite article is an א suffix after a noun, usually vowelized אָ, _au_, such as in עָלְמָא (_aulmau,_ “the world”)
Sometimes Aramaic uses the א suffix in situations that we wouldn’t use the word “the” in English, so we are calling it the definite article here for simplicity.
Hebrew also has a [[Hebrew {definite article}]], but it is a ה-prefix, as in הַמֶלֶךְ (_hamelech,_ “the king.”)


* Aramaic verb forms beginning with מ:
Several of the [[verb forms beginning with מ]] are from Aramaic:
- The Aramaic [[{pa’el active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מְזַמֵּן, _mezamen,_ “he is inviting.”)
- The Hebrew [[{ispe’el active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מִי(תְ)מְסֵיר, _mi(s’)m’seir,_ “he is being handed over.”)
- The Hebrew [[{ispa’al active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מִ(תְ)קַדַשׁ, _mi(s)kadash_ “he is being sanctified.”)
- The Hebrew [[{itaf’al active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מִיתַּפְקַד, _mitafkad_ “he is being deposited.”)


* Pronoun suffixes: In Aramaic, words in the [[participle]] can have what are called “pronoun suffixes”:
- Words like “running” which are called “participles” require a pronoun like “I” to clarify who is doing the action, eg “I am running.”
- In Aramaic, we can attach the pronoun to the end of the verb, for example, כְּתֵיב (_kseiv_) means “writing,” אֲנָא (_anau_) means “I,” and the two together, כָּתֵיבְנָא (_kauseivna_) means “I am writing.”
- (As in a regular sentence, combining a pronoun like “I” with an [[active participle]] forms the [[present tense]].)
- These are the Aramaic words that get added as suffixes:
| ‎אֲנָא ‎ <br><br> _anau_ <br><br><br> I | ‎אַתְּ‎ <br><br> _at_ <br><br><br> You [man or woman] |
| ‎אֲנַן‎ <br><br> _anan_ <br><br><br> We | ‎אַתּוּ/ן‎ <br><br> _atu/n_ <br><br><br> You [men or women] |


[Dikduk/Aramaic/Binyanim]

* Aramaic binyanim: There six binyanim in Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| *Aramaic* | [[Simple]] | [[Intensive]] | [[Causative]] |
| [[Active]]  | [[_Pe’al_]] | [[_Pa’el_]] | [[_Af’el_]] |
| [[Aramaic {Passive \/ Reflexive}]] | [[_Ispe’el_]] | [[_Ispa’al_]] | [[_Itaf’al_]] |
The binyanim of Aramaic mostly align with the [[Hebrew binyanim]].


* Aramaic Passive / Reflexive: Aramaic binyanim which are [[passive]] can also have a [[reflexive]] meaning.{! R Yitchok Frank, Grammar for Gemara, 2003}


[Dikduk/Aramaic/Binyanim/Af’el]

* Af’el: The “Af’el” (אַפְעֵל) is one of the [[Aramaic binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- A verb in the _af’el_ often has a meaning of making someone else take on properties of the [[shoresh]].
- For example, the shoresh שמע means “hearing or understanding,” and the _af’el_ verb אַשְׁמַע means “to make someone else hear or understand,” ie to teach.

[Dikduk/Binyan]

* Binyan: “Binyan” is a grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic that has no direct corollary in English. A shoresh is put in a binyan to produce a verb:
- If you take a [[shoresh]], for example אכל, which represents “eating,” and put it into a certain “binyan,” you produce a verb, for example לְהַאֲכִיל (_l’ha’achil)_, which means “to feed.”
- You can identify the binyan of a verb by its vowel sounds. Other verbs that rhyme with לְהַאֲכִיל (_l’ha’achil)_ will have similar meanings, because they are from the same “binyan.”
- Every conjugated verb has one shoresh and one binyan.
===

===

Learn more about the concept of binyan:
Here is additional explanation of the concept of “binyan”:
- Binyanim of a shoresh are [[like different flavors of the shoresh meaning]].
- Every binyan is a combination of [[five basic types of action]].
- There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].
- There are also [[nouns and adjectives that come from particular binyanim]].
===
> [[#|Back]]
===

Like different flavors of the shoresh meaning: You can think of a binyan as being a “flavor” that gets mixed with the shoresh to produce different verbs. For example:
| *The shoresh* | *Can be put into a binyan called* | *Which has a “flavor” of* | *And produces the verb* |
| אכל <br> eating | [[_hif’il_]] | causing someone else to do something | eating + causing = <br> “to feed” |
| כתב <br> writing | [[_pi’el_]] | doing something more intensely | writing + intense = <br> “to engrave” |
| קנה <br> buying | [[_nif’al_]] | having something done to you | buying + <br> something done to you = <br> “to be purchased” |
In English [[we use alternative means to achieve the same effect]].

Five basic types of action: There are five “types” of action that get combined to produce different binyanim:
- [[Active]]: Someone doing something themselves
- [[Passive]]: Someone having something done to them
- [[Simple]]: Someone doing a very straight-forward version of an action
- [[Intensive]]: Someone doing an intense or repetitive version of an action
- [[Causative]]: Someone causing someone else do an action
All of the different [[Hebrew Binyanim|binyanim of Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic Binyanim|of Aramaic]] are different combinations of these five ideas. For example, the [[_hif’il_]] is “active,” and “causative.”

We use alternative means to achieve the same effect: In English, we do not use “binyan” to produce families of related verbs.
- Rather, in English you have one simple verb like “eat,” and then you add other words to form larger ideas like “he made someone eat,” or “he was eaten,” etc, whereas in Hebrew and Aramaic those permutations are baked into the verb itself.
- Additionally, in English, words like “buy” and “sell” have no visual similarity, whereas in Hebrew and Aramaic, “to buy” (לִקְנוֹת) and “to sell” (לְהִיקָּנוֹת) would be “two binyans” of the same shoresh (קנה), and would share many of the same letters.

Nouns and adjectives that come from particular binyanim: Every verb has one binyan, and there are nouns and adjectives that come from a verb in a particular binyan.
- For example, from every _pi’el_ verb you can produce a _pi’el_ noun with the same meaning by using [[the {{_kittul_ noun pattern}}]].

A shoresh is put “into” a binyan to produce a word: Whereas a [[shoresh]] represents a vague and general category of meaning, putting that shoresh into a particular _binyan_ would produce a more specific verb or adjective. For example, the shoresh אבל corresponds to the general idea of eating, whereas putting that shoresh into a particular binyan might produce the specific verbs לֶאֱכוֹל “to eat,” לְהַאֲכִיל “to feed,” or adjective אָכוּל “eaten.”


* Active binyanim:
There are several [[active]] binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| *Actives* | [[Simple]] | [[Intensive]] | [[Causative]] |
| [[{Hebrew} Binyanim]]  | [[_Pa’al_]]  | [[_Pi’el_]] | [[_Hif’il_]] |
| [[{Aramaic} Binyanim]] | [[_Pe’al_]] | [[_Pa’el_]] | [[_Af’el_]] |


* Binyanim: There are [[seven {{Hebrew binyanim}}]] and [[six {{Aramaic binyanim}}]].


* Passive binyanim:
There are several [[passive]] binyanim in Hebrew and in Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| *Passives* | [[Simple]] | [[Intensive]] | [[Causative]] |
| [[{Hebrew} Binyanim]]  | [[_Nif’al_]]  | [[_Pu’al_]] | [[_Huf’al_]] |
| [[{Aramaic} Binyanim]] | [[_Ispe’el_]] | [[_Ispa’al_]] | [[_Itaf’al_]] |


* Active: “Active” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Active verbs represent actions where [[the person being described is the one doing the action]], as opposed to [[{{passive}} verbs]].
- There are [[several {{active binyanim}} in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

The person being described is the one doing the action: Active verbs represent actions where the person being described is the one doing the action, as opposed to [[passive]] verbs. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Active verb* | *Passive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to be eaten |
| קנה | to buy | to be purchased |
| זכר | to remember | to be remembered |
| אמר | to say | to be said |

 the verb לִקְנוֹת means “to buy,” and because it is active, the one being described is the one who is buying, as opposed to describing the thing being bought.


* Causative: “Causative” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Causative verbs often describe [[an action that makes something else change]]. A binyan that is causative has verbs that are causative and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].) There are [[several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]]:

An action that makes something else change: Causative verbs often describe an action that makes someone or something else become a certain way. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Causative verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to make someone else eat (ie to feed) |
| חזר | to return | to make something return (ie to return something) |
| בוא | to come | to make something come (ie to bring something) |
| זכר | to remember | to make something be remembered (ie to mention) |

Several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several causative binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic
- Hebrew’s [[“active”]] causative binyan is called the [[_hif’il_]]
- Hebrew’s [[“passive”]] causative binyan is called the [[_huf’al_]]
- Aramaic’s “active” causative binyan is called the [[_af’el_]]
- Aramaic’s “passive” causative binyan is called the [[_itaf’al_]]


* Intensive: “Intensive” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Intensive verbs often have meanings that are [[intensive or repetitive]].
- A binyan that is intensive has verbs that are intensive and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- There are [[several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Intensive or repetitive: Intensive verbs often have meanings that are more intensive or repetitive versions of their associated [[shoresh]], although sometimes the meaning is [[causative]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple Verb* | *Intensive Verb* |
|-|-|-|
| שבר | to break | to shatter |
| ישב | to sit | to create a settlement |
| כתב | to write | to engrave |
Ultimately these are just rules of thumb, and you can never be sure exactly what an intensive verb will mean just by looking at the meaning of its shoresh generally.

Several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several intensive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Hebrew’s [[active]] intensive binyan is the [[_pi’el_]]
- Hebrew’s [[passive]] intensive binyan is the [[_nif’al_]]
- Aramaic’s active intensive binyan is the [[_pe’al_]]
- Aramaic’s passive intensive [[_ispa’al_]]


* Passive: “Passive” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Passive verbs usually represent actions where [[action done to them|the person being described is having an action done to them]], as opposed to [[{{active}} verbs]].
- There are several [[{{passive binyanim}} in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Action done to them: Passive verbs represent actions where the thing being described is having an action done to them, as opposed to verbs that are [[active]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Active verb* | *Passive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | to eat | to be eaten |
| קנה | to buy | to be purchased |
| זכר | to remember | to be remembered |
| אמר | to say | to be said |
This is a rule of thumb, although sometimes passive verbs have [[{{reflexive}} meanings]].

* Reflexive: “Reflexive” is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- Reflexive verbs often refer to circular or transformative actions. [[Circular or transformative|<small>(→)</small>]]
- There are [[several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Circular or transformative:
Reflexive verbs often describe an action where the doer does something to themselves.
For example, the shoresh לבש corresponds to the concept of clothing, and the causative verb from that shoresh is לְהִתְלַבֵּשׁ, which means “to dress oneself.”
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Reflexive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| לבש | to dress | to dress oneself |
| בדד | to seperate | to go into isolation |
| בלל | to mix | to assimilate |
| גדר | to fence | to limit oneself to something |
Reflexive verbs can also refer to situations where an entity undergoes a transformation, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *Simple verb* | *Reflexive verb* |
|-|-|-|
| חדש | to be new | to revitalize |
| זקן | to be old | to grow old |
| חרש | to be deaf | to become deaf |
===
> [[#]]
===

Several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several reflexive binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Hebrew’s reflexive binyan is called the [[_hispa’el_]]
- Aramaic’s [[passive]] binyanim, [[_ispe’el_]], [[ispa’al]], and [[itaf’al]], can also be reflexive.
- In general [[{{passive}} verbs]] can also sometimes have reflexive meanings.


* Simple: “Simple” (also known as _kal)_ is a category of verb in Hebrew and Aramaic. Simple verbs usually have [[meanings that are similar to their shoresh]]. A binyan that is simple has verbs that are simple and vice versa. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].) There are [[several “simple” binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic]].

Meanings that are similar to their shoresh: Simple verbs have meanings that are very similar to their associated [[shoresh]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *Simple verb* |
|-|-|-|
| אכל | eating | to eat |
| הלח | walking | to walk |
| אמר | speech | to say |
| ישב | sitting | to sit |

 the shoresh אכל represents the idea of eating, whereas the simple verb of that shoresh is לֶאֱכוֹל, which means “to eat.”

Several simple binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic:
There are several “simple” binyanim in Hebrew and Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- Hebrew’s [[“active”]] simple binyan is called the [[_pa’al_]]
- Hebrew’s [[“passive”]] simple binyan is called the [[_nif’al_]]
- Aramaic’s “active” simple binyan is called the [[_pe’al_]]
- Aramaic’s “passive” simple binyan is called the [[_ispe’el_]]


* Stative verbs: Stative verbs are a category of verb that sometimes have special conjugations in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- A stative verb usually describe static qualities as opposed to actions.
| *Example stative verb* | *Meaning* |
| כּבֵד | to be heavy |
| חָכַם | to be wise |
| זָקֵן | to be old |
- Stative verbs are found in the [[simple]] binyanim, [[_pa’al_]] for Hebrew and [[_pe’al_]] for Aramaic.

* Suffix ו: The suffix ו can follow a [[verb]] or a [[noun]].

Noun:
If ו follows a noun, it can mean “his” or “its.” E.g. adding ו to בית (_bayis_, house) produces ביתו (_baito_, “his house”)

Verb:
If ו follows a verb, it can mean the action was done to “him” or “it.” E.g. שָׁמָרוֹ (_shamaro_, “he guarded it.”)


* ה at the start of a word:
This is a list of some of the things that a ה at the beginning of a word can mean:
1. A noun starting with the word “the” which is a ה prefix in Hebrew ([[Hebrew definite article|More]])
2. A type of Hebrew past-tense verb that begins with ה ([[Verb forms beginning with ה|More]])
3. A name of something that starts with ה
4. A word formed from a [[shoresh]] that starts with ה
5. A special ה prefix that turns a sentence into a question. [[ה interrogative particle|(More)]]


[Dikduk/Forms]

* Forms of the active participle in Aramaic:
These are the examples of the participle in the masculine singular for each of the [[Aramaic binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| Binyan        | Type | Example | Transliteration |
|---------------|------|---------|----------------|
| [[_Pe’al_]] | [[simple]], [[active]] | כָּתֵיב | _kauseiv_ |
| [[_Ispe’el_]] | [[simple]], [[passive]] | מִתְכְּתִב | _miskesiv_ |
| [[_Pa’el_]] | [[intensive]], [[active]] | מְקַדֵּיש | _mekad’deish_ |
| [[_Ispa’al_]] | [[intensive]], [[passive]] | מְתְקַדַש | _miskadash_ |
| [[_Af’el_]] | [[causative]], [[active]] | מַכְתִּיב | _machtiv_ |
| [[_Itaf’al_]] | [[causative]] [[passive]], or [[reflexive]] | מִתַּפְקַד | _mitafkad_ |

For gender and number:
The participle is conjugated for gender and number:
| Person | Hebrew | Transliteration | Meaning |
|---------|--------|----------------|---------|
| Masculine singular | כּוֹתֵב | _koseiv_ | one man writing |
| Feminine singular | כּוֹתֶבֶת | _koseves_ | one woman writing |
| Masculine plural | כּוֹתְבִים | _kosvim_ | multiple men writing |
| Feminine plural | כּוֹתְבוֹת | _kosvos_ | multiple women writing |
This is unlike the [[past tense]] or [[future tense]] that have [[separate forms for person]]. This is because the participle in Hebrew and Aramaic is [[like an adjective]].

Separate forms for person: Tenses other than the participle have conjugations for every person, eg the [[_pa’al_]] [[past tense]]:
| *Person* | *Hebrew* | *Transliteration* | *Meaning* |
|---------|--------|----------------|---------|
| First singular | כָּתַבְתִּי | _kosavti_ | I wrote |
| First-person plural | כּוֹתְבוֹת | _kosavnu_ | We wrote |
| Second singular masculine | כָּתַבְתָּ | _kosavto_ | You (man) wrote |
| Second singular feminine | כָּתַבְתְּ | _kosavt_ | You (woman) wrote |
| Second plural masculine | כְּתַבְתֶּם | _ksavtem_ | You (men) wrote |
| Second plural feminine | כְּתַבְתֶּן | _ksavten_ | You (women) wrote |
| Third plural masculine | כָּתַב | _kosav_ | He wrote |
| Third plural feminine | כָּתְבָה | _kosvo_ | She wrote |
| They/those | כָּתְבוּ | _kosvu_ | They wrote |

Like an adjective: The participle in Hebrew and Aramaic is more like an adjective than a verb, with “he is running” having the same grammatical form as “he is tall.” (This example uses the participle of the [[_{{pa’al}} binyan_]]. [[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)

* Active Participle: The active participle, usually just called “the participle” (and sometimes called the present participle or _lashon po’el)_ is one of the [[tenses of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- In English, an example of the active participle is the word “running.”
- The active participle can be used to make sentences like “I am running,” or “I was running.”

> [[Additional information about the active participle|More]]
===

Additional information about the active participle:
This is additional information about the active participle:
- The active participle describes an ongoing action, as opposed to [[the {{passive participle}}]].
- Participles can only be used when combined with other words in special combinations called [[participle {constructions}]].
- The active participle has [[{forms } of the active participle {in Hebrew}]] and [[{forms } of the active participle {in Aramaic}]].


* Future Tense: The future tense is one of the [[tenses of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- The future tense generally describes a future action.
- However, the future tense has [[several alternative uses]].

Several alternative uses: The future tense generally describes a future action, however:
- The future tense [[can describe a command]].
- The future tense [[can describe a moral suggestion]].
- The future tense [[can describe a prayer]].
- The future tense [[can describe a request]]

Can describe a command: The future tense can describe a command.
- For example, תִּכְתֹּב (_tichtov_, literally “you will write,”) can mean “you _shall_ write.”
- The _Torah_ generally expresses positive commandments using the [[{{imperative}} form]], but negative commandments are often expressed using the future tense, such as לֹא תִּרְצָח, “thou shalt not kill.”

Can describe a prayer:
The future tense can describe a prayer.
- For example, השם יְרַחֵם, _Hashem yeracheim_ (literally “Hashem will be compassionate”) can mean “I pray Hashem will be compassionate.”
- It may be that this usage is just an example of the former category of “moral suggestion,” i.e. the speaker may literally be saying “Hashem _should be_ compassionate,” by which he means “I hope that Hashem is compassionate.”

Can describe a moral suggestion:
The future tense can describe a moral suggestion.
- For example, תַּעֲזֹר, _ta’azoir_ (lit. “you will help”) can mean “you should help.”

Can describe a request:
The future tense can describe a request:
- For example, Moshe says in _Parshas Va’eschanan_ אֶעְבְּרָה־נָּ֗א (_e’b’rah nah_, lit. “I will cross, please”)
- Clearly Moshe isn’t telling Hashem he will cross, but is asking to cross.


* Imperative: The imperative, also known as “the command form,” is one of the [[tenses of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- An example of an imperative in English is “run!”
- The imperative describes an action that the speaker is telling the listener to do.


* Infinitive: The infinitive is one of the [[tenses of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- An example of an infinitive in English is “to run.”
- An infinitive describes an action without specifying who is doing it.


* Participle: The participle is a category of verb that appears in most languages.
- An example of a word in the participle is “burning” or “running.”
- Hebrew and Aramaic have two participle forms, [[the {{“active” participle}} form]], and [[the {{“passive” participle}} form]].
- Unlike words in the past or future tense which can be used alone as full sentences, participle words only form meaningful sentences when combined with other words in one of several “[[{{participle constructions}}]].”


* Participle constructions: Participle constructions are when a word in [[the {{participle}}]] is combined with other words in special combinations to express larger ideas.
- The most common “construction” is when [[a participle is combined with a noun to produce a sentence in the {{present tense}}]].
- There are participle constructions [[for describing actions in various time periods]].
- Words in the participle [[can be used as nouns]] or [[can be used as adjectives]].
- All of these rules apply to both the [[active participle]] and the [[passive participle]].

For describing actions in various time periods:
A word in the [[participle]] can be combined with other words to describe actions in different time periods.
- A word in the participle by itself technically [[has no time]].
- However, it can be used [[in the past]] or [[in the future]] using different constructions.

Has no time: A word in the participle of Hebrew or Aramaic does not alone tell us what time the action happened. This is like the English word “running,” which only describes an action, not when it happened. We require the context of the sentence to determine the time of the action.

In the past: The participle can be used in the past tense.
- For example, the Hebrew הוּא הָיָה כּוֹתֵב (_hu haya koisev_) meaning “he used to write” or “he used to be writing.”
- If you wanted to say “he wrote,” i.e. a one-time past event instead of an ongoing past event, you would just use the regular [[past tense]], and not the “past-tense construction” of the participle.

In the future: The participle can be used in the future tense.
- For example, the Hebrew הוּא יִהְיֶה כּוֹתֵב (_hu yiyeh koisev_), meaning “he will be writing.”
- If you wanted to say “he will write,” i.e. a one-time future event, you would just use the regular [[future tense]] and not the “future-tense construction” of the participle.

Can be used as nouns: The participle can be used as a noun in two ways:
- A participle [[can describe someone doing an action]].
- A participle [[can describe an instance of an action]].

Can describe someone doing an action:
The participle can represent someone doing a given action. For example:
| *General* | *Specific* |
| *רָץ* צָרִיךְ נַעְלַיִם <br><br> _*ratz* tzaurich na’alayim_ <br><br><br> *a runner* needs shoes | *הַרָץ* צָרִיךְ נַעְלַיִם <br><br> _*ha’ratz* tzaurich na’alayim_ <br><br><br> *the runner* needs shoes |
Here, we see the Hebrew word “running” can also mean “a person who is running,” and that adding a ה means “the person who is running,” a form found often in the Mishnah.
<br><br>
A very common example is the word “tzadik,” which is used to mean “righteous man,” when really it literally is just the adjective “righteous,” as used in Koheles 7:20:
< כִּי אָדָם אֵין *צַדִּיק* בָּאָרֶץ אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂה טוֹב וְלֹא יֶחֱטָא
> For regarding men, there is none who is *righteous* on the earth, one who will not sin.

Can describe an instance of an action:
The participle can represent an instance of an action, (although this may be very uncommon.) For example:
|‎ *כּוֹתֵב* שֶׁלוֹ תַּמִיד <br><br> _*kosev* shelo tamid_ <br><br><br> his *writing* is constant | *זוֹעֵק* שֶׁלוֹ הַרְבֵּה <br><br> _*zo’eik* shelo harbe_ <br><br><br> his *yelling* is numerous |
Here, we see that the Hebrew word “writing” can be used as a noun, meaning “a particular instance of the act of writing.”

Can be used as adjectives: A participle can be used as an adjective, eg:
| Hebrew  | שִׁמְעוׄן *יָשׁוּב* |
|-|-|
| Transliteration | _Shimeon *yashuv*_ |
| English | Shimeon is *seated* |
- Really, all participles are essentially adjectives, which is why they only have [[_Pa’al_ Active Participle for Regular Shorushim|four conjugations for gender and number]] as opposed to [[_Pa’al_ Past Tense for regular shorushim|other tenses that have conjugations for different people]].
- I.e., in Hebrew and Aramaic, the words “tall” and “running” in the sentences “I am tall” and “I am running” are both the same type of word.


* Passive Participle: The passive participle (sometimes called _lashon pa’ul_ or _pa’il)_ is a verb tense in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- In English, examples of passive participles are the words “written,” or “burnt.”
- A passive participle represents the result of an action (eg “burnt”) as opposed to an ongoing action (eg “burning,”) which would be an [[active participle]].
===
> [[Additional information about the passive participle|More]]
===

Additional information about the passive participle:
Here is additional information about the passive participle:
- Passive participles are adjectives that are formed from verbs, for example “burnt” comes from the verb “to burn.”
- The passive participle in Hebrew looks like כָּתוּב (_kasuv)_, and in Aramaic like כְּתִיב (_kasiv)_.
- In Hebrew the passive participle only exists in [[the {{_pa’al_}} binyan]], i.e. [[the {{pa’al passive participle}}]].
- In Aramaic, there are passive participles in all of the active binyanim, i.e. the [[pe’al passive participle]], the [[pa’el passive participle]], and the [[af’el passive participle]].
- There are [[{|subtle }differences in meaning between the passive participle of active binyanim and the active participle of passive binyanim]].
- Like [[the {{active participle}}]], the passive participle only has meaning in [[one of several {{“participle constructions”}}]].

Differences in meaning between the passive participle of active binyanim and the active participle of passive binyanim:
Many students confuse the passive participle of active binyanim like [[_pa’al_]] and [[the {{active participle}}]] of [[passive binyanim]]:
- For example, what is the difference between the [[{|active} _pa’al_ {|binyan’s} passive participle]], כָּתוּב (_kasuv)_, and the [[{|passive} _nif’al_ {|binyan’s} active participle]], נִכְתָּב _nichtav?_
- The [[simple]] [[passive]] binyanim i.e. [[the Hebrew {{_nif’al_}}]] and [[the Aramaic {{_ispe’el_}}]] represent an ongoing action being done to the subject e.g. “it is _being_ written” or “it is _regularly_ written upon.”
- The passive participle כָּתוּב (_kasuv)_, by contrast, would mean “it is written,” without a connection to an ongoing action.


* Past tense: The past tense is one of the [[tenses of Hebrew and Aramaic]].


* Present tense: The present tense in Hebrew and Aramaic is formed by combining a [[participle]] with a pronoun in a special [[{“participle construction”}s]]:
- The present tense is produced by taking a pronoun like הוּא (_hu_, “he”) followed by a participle like כּוֹתֵב (_koseiv_, “writing”) producing a sentence, “he is writing.”
- There is no word equivalent to “is” in Hebrew and Aramaic, so we just say “he writing” and the “is” is implied by context.
- Even though the [[active participle]] is sometimes called the “present tense” (or לְשׁוֹן הוֹוֶה _lashon hoveh)_, an active participle by itself like כּוֹתֵב (_koseiv_, “writing”) is not necessarily in the present tense, and can be used in the past or future, as in “he was writing.”
- [[The Hebrew and Aramaic “present tense” correspond to both the English present tense and participle]].

The Hebrew and Aramaic “present tense” correspond to both the English present tense and participle: The Hebrew and Aramaic “present tense” construction corresponds to multiple English verb forms:
- In English, you can say “he is writing” (English participle) or “he writes” (English present tense.)
- In Hebrew and Aramaic, both of these forms would be expressed with the same participle construction i.e. הוּא כּוֹתֵב (_hu koseiv_.)
- Therefore, when we see a sentence like הוּא כּוֹתֵב (_hu koseiv)_, we can’t be sure whether it means “he is writing” or “he writes.”
- As English has many more words than Hebrew and Aramaic, it is quite common for multiple words in English to be the same word in Hebrew or Aramaic, producing ambiguities when translating from Hebrew or Aramaic back to English.


* Tenses of Hebrew and Aramaic: There are several verb forms and tenses in Hebrew and Aramaic:
| [[Past Tense]] | [[Future Tense]] | [[{{Active Participle}}]] |
| [[Imperative]] | [[Infinitive]] | [[Passive Participle]] |


[Dikduk/Hebrew]

* Hebrew definite article: Hebrew has something called a definite article, as do many languages.
(The definite article in English is the word “the.”)
Definite articles are used to refer to things that are already known to the reader.
===
> [[More]]
===

More:
In Hebrew, the definite article is a ה-prefix before a noun, usually pronounced הַ, _ha_, e.g. as in הַכֶּלֶב, _hakelev_, “the dog.”
The term in Hebrew for “definite article” is ה"א הַיְּדִיעָה, _hay hayediah_, literally “the hay of knowledge,” i.e. because it is used to refer to something that is already known to the reader.
Sometimes, the הַ gets combined with [[the {{prefix ב}}]] or [[the {{prefix ל}}]], and becomes a בַ or לַ, meaning e.g. “in the” or “to the.” For example, adding ב before הַבַּיִת (_habayis_, “the house”) becomes בַּבַּיִת (_babayis_ “in the house,” as opposed to _b’bayis_, “in a house.”)
Aramaic also has a definite article, but it is an א-suffix not a ה-prefix, as in עָלְמָ*א* (_alma,_ “the world.”) [[Aramaic definite article|<small>→</small>]]

* Prefix כש: The Hebrew prefix כש is short for the Hebrew word [[כַּאֲשֶׁר]] meaning “when.”


[Dikduk/Hebrew/Binyanim]

* Hebrew binyanim: There are seven binyanim in Hebrew. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| *Hebrew* | [[Simple]] | [[Intensive]] | [[Causative]] | [[Reflexive]] |
|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|

The binyanim of Hebrew mostly align with the [[Aramaic binyanim]].


[Dikduk/Hebrew/Binyanim/Hif’il]

* Hif’il: The “Hif’il” (הִפְעִיל) is one of the [[hebrew binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- If you take a [[shoresh]] like קדש which means “holiness” and put it in the _hif’il_ binyan, it produces a verb that means “causing” something else to become holy, i.e. “donating something to the temple.”

[Dikduk/Interrogatives]

* Interrogative particles:
There are several words and prefixes that can turn a statement into a question.
- These constructs are helpful because traditional Hebrew and Aramaic have no question mark.
- The most common such construct is the Hebrew [[ה interrogative particle]].
- Another example is the [[מי interrogative participle]] which exists in Hebrew and Aramaic.


* ה interrogative particle:
Hebrew has a ה prefix that turns a given sentence into a question.
- In traditional grammar it is called the _hei hashayla_, ה"א השאלה, “question ה.”
- This is not to be confused with the [[Hebrew definite article|Hebrew ה prefix meaning “the”]].
- An example of the _hei hashayla_ would be הֲיֵ֣שׁ לָכֶ֣ם אָ֔ח, _hayesh lechem ach_. Alone, _yesh lechem ach_, יֵ֣שׁ לָכֶ֣ם אָ֔ח would mean “you all have a brother.” With the ה prefix, it means “do you all have a brother?”
- The ה question prefix is usually vowelized as -הֲ, “ha.”
- Sometimes the ה question prefix is found as a standalone word, הַאִם, _ha’im_ which begins a question.


* מי interrogative participle:
The word מִי in Hebrew and Aramaic can be used to convert a statement into a question.
- This is separate from the meaning of מִי as “who.”
- An example would be מי כאן הלל, “is Hillel here?”

| קשר <br> connection | הִקְשִׁיר <br><br> _hikshir_ <br><br><br> he connected | הֶקְשֵׁר <br><br> _heksher_ <br><br><br> a connection | הַקְשָׁרָה <br><br> _hakshara_ <br><br><br> an act of connecting |
As you can see, the _hif’il_ verb represents an action, the _haktala_ noun represents an instance of that action, and the _hektel_ noun will represent the _result_ of that action. Not every _hif’il_ verb however will have both a _hektel_ and a _haktala_ form. For a full list of _hektel-haktala_ word pairs, see [Klein on _havdalah_](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%94%D6%B7%D7%91%D6%B0%D7%93%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%9C%D6%B8%D7%94.1).


* Construct state:
In many languages there is a way of combining two nouns to produce a combination noun.
- For example, in English I can say something is “The Bank Headquarters” and use “Bank” as an adjective even though it is a noun.
- Common phrases like “post office” and “police station” use this construct form.
- The construct form is called the “smichus” סמיכות in traditional grammar.
- The construct form is contrasted with the absolute form, which is just a regular noun like “the apple.”

* Hebrew noun patterns: Hebrew has several noun patterns, which are letter and vowel templates that accept shorushim to produce nouns. Nouns formed from a certain pattern often have a similar meaning relative to the shoresh. Noun patterns [[have a naming convention]]. These are some of the noun patterns in Hebrew:
===
- [[By first letter]]
- [[By binyan]]
===

By first letter:
These are Hebrew noun patterns by first letter:
- [[Noun patterns that begin with מ]]
- [[Noun patterns that begin with ה]]
- [[Noun patterns that begin with with the first shoresh letter]]

By Binyan:
These are Hebrew noun patterns by binyan:
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Pa’al_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Pi’el_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Hif’il_ verbs]]
- [[Noun patterns that come from _Hispa’el_ verbs]]

Have a naming convention: Noun patterns are named by putting the shoresh קטל into the given pattern, the same way that binyan names are formed by putting the shoresh פעל into the third-person masculine past-tense form of that binyan.

[Dikduk/Nouns/Articles]

* Articles: Articles are a grammatical entity that exists in most languages.
- Articles are words like “the” or “a” that come before a noun.
- Articles clarify whether the thing being spoken about is known to the listener (“the dog” i.e. the [[definite article]]), or whether we are speaking in general (“a dog” i.e. the [[indefinite article]].)


* Definite Article: A definite article is a grammatical entity in most languages.
In English, the definite article is the word “the,” as in “the cat,” as opposed to “a cat,” which is the [[indefinite article]].
A definite article is one of the [[two types of {{articles}}]], along with [[the {{indefinite article}}]]
A definite article clarifies that the noun being spoken about is already known to the listener
There is a [[Hebrew definite article]] and an [[Aramaic definite article]]


* Indefinite Article: An indefinite article is a grammatical entity in most languages.
An indefinite article is one of the [[two types of {{articles}}]].
An indefinite article clarifies that we are speaking about any entity within a given category.
In English, the definite article is the word “a,” as in “a cat,” as opposed to “the cat,” which would be the [[definite article]].
There is a [[Hebrew definite article]] and an [[Aramaic definite article]]


[Dikduk/Shoresh]

* Shoresh: Shoresh or “root” is a grammatical entity in Hebrew and Aramaic.
- An example of a shoresh is “א-כ-ל,” which represents the idea of “eating.”
- A shoresh is used to produce many related words, like אוֹכֶל, which means “food,” or אֲכִילָה, which means “the act of eating.”
- The shoresh is just a series of letters and is not itself a word, and has no vowels or pronunciation.

Learn more about the concept of shoresh:
This is additional information on the concept of shoresh:
- A shoresh is a series of letters that represents a wide range of meaning, <br> like אכל (eating) שלח (sending) or ראה (sight)
- The word “shoresh” [[means root]] because shorushim are [[used to produce words]].
- Shorushim [[generally have three letters, but may sometimes have two or four letters]].
- There are [[regular shorushim]] and [[irregular shorushim]].
===
> [[#|Back]]
===

Means root:
The word shoresh can mean “root” or “source.”
- In this context, it means “root” in the sense that a words like “memory” and “memorize” come from the same linguistic root “mem.”

Generally have three letters, but may sometimes have two or four letters:
Shorushim generally have three letters. However:
- Some shorushim, [[appear to have two letters]].
- Some shorushim have [[Four-letter shorushim|have four letters]].

Appear to have two letters: Sometimes, we find words that only appear to have two recognizable letters, like מֵת, (_meis_, “he is dying.”)
- Some consider the word מֵת to come from a two-letter shoresh “מת”
- Some consider מֵת to come from a shoresh “מות,” whose “weak middle letter” gets hidden in certain conjugations. (Examples of “weak” letters are י,‎ ו and ה.)
- Either way, it is just a disagreement about what to call things, not over the spelling of any actual word.
- This site generally uses three letter shorushim like “מות” to keep things consistent, but either system is correct.

Corollaries in English: In English, you often have a linguistic root like “mem” which is used to produce a series of related words like “memory,” “memorize,” or “memorable.” Shorushim are a similar concept, except they are a bit more formal than in English, because there are fixed rules for how many letters they can be, and how they get turned into words.

Used to produce words: A shoresh is called a “root” because many words derive from one shoresh.
- A shoresh has a general meaning is used to generate many words with more specific meanings.
- For example, the shoresh אכל “eating” can be plugged into a particular verb pattern to generate the verb לְהַאֲכִיל, _leha’achil_, “to feed.”
- (For advanced readers, these patterns are called [[{{binyan}}im]], and לְהַאֲכִיל comes from the [[{{“hif’il”}} binyan]].)

Debate over the exact definition of a shoresh: Often we see words that only seem to have two root letters, like מת, and there is a debate over whether to think of these as being a special type of “two letter” shoresh, or whether to think of them as being a three-letter shoresh like מות that loses the middle letter in certain conjugations, but this dispute has no practical ramifications because everyone agrees on the spelling of the words that come from two-letter shorushim.


* Four-letter shorushim: While most shorushim have three letters, sometimes we see shorushim that seem to have four distinct letters.
- For example: שבעד, meaning “subjugation,” or טלטל meaning “movement.”
- These four-letter shorushim [[can only have verb forms in certain binyanim]].
- Four letter shorushim are often special forms of normal shorushim, like the [[_shaf’el_]] and the [[_pilpul_]] forms, although [[some seem to have intrinsic meanings]].

Can only have verb forms in certain binyanim:
Four-letter shorushim can only have verb forms in [[{{binyan}}im]] with a doubled middle letter, like the [[_pi’el_]].
- This is because the doubled letter creates room for the four consonant sounds of the shoresh:
| *Shoresh* | *[[_Pi’el_]] example* | *Notes*|
| דבר <br> speech | מְדַ*בֵּ*ר <br><br> _meda*b*’*b*er_ <br><br><br> he is saying | - This is a regular three-letter shoresh. <br> - The middle בּ (“b”) is said twice <br> - I.e. both “middle slots” are used for בּ |
| שׁחרר <br> liberation | מְשַׁ*חְרֵ*ר <br><br> _mesha*ch*’*r*eir_ <br><br><br> he is liberating | - This is a four-letter shoresh <br> - First middle slot is used for ח (“ch”) <br> - Second middle slot is used for ר (“r”)|
| טלטל <br> movement | מְטַ*לְטֵ*ל <br><br> _meta*l’t*el_ <br><br><br> he is moving | - This is a four-letter shoresh <br> - First middle slot is used for ל (“l”) <br> - Second middle slot is used for ט (“t”) |
- A verb form without a doubled middle letter, like כּוֹתֵב (_kosev_, “writing”), wouldn’t have room to accomidate the four consonants of a four-letter shoresh. (For advanced students, כּוֹתֵב is an example of a form called the [[_pa’al_ active participle]].)

Some seem to have intrinsic meanings: Some four letter shorushim seem to be intrinsically meaningful and are not related to other shorushim. For example:
- פרנס, “livelihood,” used in verbs like לְפַרְנֵס _lefarneis_ “to support financially.”
- קטרג, “accusation,” used in verbs like לְקַטְרֵג _lekatreig_, “to accuse”


* Irregular shorushim: An irregular shoresh, as opposed to a [[regular shor{ushim|esh}]], is a [[shoresh]] that has special letters that affect the vowelization of verbs produced from it. Here are some examples of irregular shorushim and their irregular verb conjugations:
| *Shoresh* | *Irregularity* | *Expected <br> Conjugation* | * Real <br> Conjugation* | *Comment* |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| ישב | י in first position | מֵישִׁיב (_mayshiv)_ | מוֹשִׁיב (_moshiv)_ | י changes to וֹ |
| נפל | נ in the first position | מַנְפִּיל (_manpil)_ | מַפִּיל (_map’pil)_ | נ drops, and the פ is doubled |
| בנה | ה in the last position | בָּנַהְתִּי  (_baunah’ti)_ | בָּנִיתִי (_bauniti)_ | the consonant ה becomes an יִ vowel, like “bee” |
There is a [[special naming convention]] for describing categories of irregular shorushim.

Special naming convention: We use the traditional [[shoresh letter numbering convention]] to produce an [[irregular shoresh naming convention]].

Shoresh letter numbering convention:
In Hebrew grammar, the shoresh פעל is used as a “standard” shoresh, and so sometimes the letters of פעל are used as names for the three shoresh positions:
| פ | ע | ל |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
 For example, instead of saying “the first letter of the shoresh נפל,” you might say “the פ of the shoresh נפל.”

Irregular shoresh naming convention:
Because we use the letters פעל as names for the positions in a shoresh, if we want to say “the category of shorushim that have a י in the first position,” the name would be “י״פ verbs” (_yud-pay verbs_.)

A common example is a shoresh that has a י in the first position, such as ישב, where the י will often becomes a ו in verb forms that have prefixes, for example having מוֹשִׁיב (_moshiv)_ instead of the more typical מֵישִׁיב (_mayshiv)_, which might be harder to pronounce.


* Pilpul: The _pilpul_ is a form where a weak shoresh with only two strong letters (eg טול) or a shoresh with a repeated second letter (eg לחח) has the first and last letters doubled to produce a [[four-letter {shorushim|shoresh}]]. For example:
| *Shoresh* | *Meaning* | *_Shif’el_ Shoresh* | *Meaning* |
|-|-|-|-|
| טול | to move | טלטל | to teeter about |
| לחח | to be moist | לחלח | to moisten |
| בלל | to mix | בלבל | to confuse |
| משׁשׁ | to touch | משׁמשׁ | to examine physically |
The meaning of the _pilpul_ form is often a more repetitive version of the meaning of the two-letter form. Like all four-letter shorushim, a _pilpul_ shoresh can only have forms in binyanim that feature a doubled middle consonant sound, such as the [[_pi’el_]], [[_pu’al_]], and [[_hispa’el_]] forms.


* Regular shorushim: A regular [[shoresh]] is a shoresh where the vowels and spelling of verbs that are produced from that shoresh follow the normal patterns for each verb form. This is as opposed to [[irregular shorushim]].


* Shaf’el: The _shaf’el_ form is a special type of [[four-letter shor{ushim|esh}]].
- It is produced by taking a shoresh like עבד and adding a ש to the front to produce a new shoresh like שעבד.
- A three-letter shoresh put into the _shaf’el_ will become a [[four-letter {shorushim|shoresh}]]
- A shoresh with only two strong letters when put into the _shaf’el_ will become a three-letter shoresh, for example:
| *Shoresh* | *_Shif’el_ Shoresh* | *Notes* |
| עבד <br> work | שעבד <br> subjugate <br> (to make someone else work) | This is a three-letter shoresh that becomes a four letter shoresh |
| זרע <br> seeding | שזרע <br> reseeding (causing to become seeded) | This is a three-letter shoresh that becomes a four letter shoresh |
| נוע <br> moving | שנע <br> transporting (causing to move) | This is a “weak” shoresh with only two strong letters, and it becomes a three letter shoresh |
The addition of the ש produces a shoresh that has a [[causative]] meaning relative to the original shoresh. Like all four-letter shorushim, a _shaf’el_ shoresh can only have forms in binyanim that feature a doubled middle consonant sound, such as the [[_pi’el_]], [[_pu’al_]], and [[_hispa’el_]] forms.


* Strong letters: In Hebrew and Aramaic, letters are considered “strong” if they appear in all conjugations of a shoresh and never drop.
- Strong letters are those that are not [[weak letters]].


* Weak letters: In Hebrew and Aramaic, some letters are considered “weak” in that it is not clear if they are part of a word’s [[shoresh]] or whether they are added as vowels or part of a conjugation. Sometimes, weak letters act as consonants, and are pronounced strongly.
- The weak letters are ‎א, ‎ע, ‎ה, ‎ח, ‎י, ‎ו, and ‎נ.
- Letters that are not weak are [[strong letters]].

* Mishnah Ha’ish Mekadesh:
Perek Ha’ish mekadesh begins with the first Mishnah of the second perek:
< *האיש* מקדש בו ובשלוחו
< האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה
< האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו:

< [[האיש]] [[מקדש]] [[את]] [[בתו]] [[כשהיא]] [[נערה]] [[בו]] [[ובשלוחו]]:
===
> [[#Literal]]
===

Literal:
This is a literal translation of the Mishnah, identifying the general meanings of the words but not adapting them to fit the current context.{! You can use this step to practice going from the literal meanings of the words to the contextual meaning of the text.}
The Mishnah begins:
< הָאִישׁ מְקַדֵּשׁ בּוֹ וּבִשְׁלוּחוֹ
< _ha’ish mekadesh bo ub’shlucho_
“The man is/is being _mekadesh_ via himself and/or via his _shaliach_ i.e. emissary.”
The expression “to be _mekadesh_” can have a range of meanings. Literally it means for someone to make holiness. Practically that could refer to a man who makes _kiddush_ before a Shabbos meal, a man who halachically engages a woman for marriage, or anyone who does an action that increases holiness in the world.
< הָאִשָּׁה מִתְקַדֶּשֶׁת בָּהּ וּבִשְׁלוּחָהּ
< _ha’isha miskadeshes bah ub’shluchah_
“The woman is _miskadeshes_ via herself and/or via her _shaliach_ i.e. emissary.”
A woman can “be _miskadeshes_” if she “becomes holy,” i.e. via any of the aforementioned meanings.
< הָאִישׁ מְקַדֵּשׁ אֶת בִּתּוֹ כְּשֶׁהִיא נַעֲרָה בּוֹ וּבִשְׁלוּחוֹ
< _ha’ish mekadesh es bito k’sh’hi na’arah bo ub’shlucho_
“The man is/is being _mekadesh_ his daughter when she is a _na’ara_ via himself and/or via her _shaliach_ i.e. emissary.”
===
< [[#Words]]
> [[#Basic]]
===

Basic:
This is a “basic” explanation of the Mishnah, clarifying the contextual meanings of the words and answering questions a beginner might have, but not dealing with analytical questions or observations. {! Use this step to practice taking the basic meaning of the text and identifying difficulties or observations that will be addressed by the later commentators.}
< הָאִישׁ מְקַדֵּשׁ בּוֹ וּבִשְׁלוּחוֹ
“The man is/is being _mekadesh_ via himself and/or via his _shaliach_ i.e. emissary.”
Given that we are in meseches Kiddushin which deals primarily with marriage law, we can determine that the meaning of מקדש here is the creation of the _kiddushin_ initial stage of marriage that precedes the final _nisuyin_ stage. Once a man is _mekadesh_ a woman, she would need a get i.e. bill of divorce from him in order to remarry.
Additionally, “ongoing” verbs in the Mishnah generally signify the permissibly of an action. So, “the man is being mekadesh” really means "a man can/may be mekadesh in the following ways, i.e. himself or with his emissary. So now we see the purpose of the Mishnah is to convey the surprising idea that the initial stage of marriage can be done remotely by a designated third-party.
< הָאִשָּׁה מִתְקַדֶּשֶׁת בָּהּ וּבִשְׁלוּחָהּ
“The woman is miskadeshes i.e. becomes halachically designated for marriage, via herself or her _shaliach_ i.e. emissary, i.e. she may do so.”
< הָאִישׁ מְקַדֵּשׁ אֶת בִּתּוֹ כְּשֶׁהִיא נַעֲרָה בּוֹ וּבִשְׁלוּחוֹ
“The man is mekadesh his daugher when she is a 12.5 year old girl, via himself or his emissary. Again, we see that the ongoing verb in the Mishnah indicates permissibly, so this should be rendered "a man _may_ initiate the first _kiddushin_ step of marriage when his daughter is 12.5, via himself or via his _shaliach_ i.e. emissary.”
===
< [[#Literal]]
> [[#Analysis]]
===

Analysis:
This is a recap of the text of the Mishnah, paying greater attention to nuances and difficulties beyond the simple translation. {! Use this step to practice explaining the nuances and difficulties of the text before seeing how the later commentators do so.}
< הָאִישׁ מְקַדֵּשׁ בּוֹ וּבִשְׁלוּחוֹ
< _ha’ish mekadesh bo ub’shlucho_
“A man may produce the _kiddushin_ stage proceeding marriage with a woman, via himself or via his shaliach i.e. emissary.”
We might ask, why did the Mishnah feel it necessary to mention that he can produce _kiddushin_ with a woman via himself? Isn’t it be obvious from that there is such a thing as _kiddushin_ that the man himself can produce it, otherwise how else would it occur normally?
Additionally, perhaps the verses in the Torah which describe the marriage process imply he can do it himself?
Perhaps the Mishnah has to list every possibility even if the reader already knows one or can infer it from the others? If so, the Mishnah would make more sense. If not, for what purpose might the Mishnah add extra things to a list? Let’s keep the question in mind going forward.
< הָאִשָּׁה מִתְקַדֶּשֶׁת בָּהּ וּבִשְׁלוּחָהּ
< _ha’isha miskadeshes bah ub’shluchah_
“A woman may become halachically engaged i.e. may accept the _kiddushin_ stage of marriage, via herself or via her shaliach i.e. emissary.”
Again we might ask why it needs to mention that she can do it herself, as this seems like the standard way it would be done, and even if I didn’t know that initially, telling me she can do it via emissary would seem to imply she can do it herself.
< הָאִישׁ מְקַדֵּשׁ אֶת בִּתּוֹ כְּשֶׁהִיא נַעֲרָה בּוֹ וּבִשְׁלוּחוֹ
< _ha’ish mekadesh es bito k’sh’hi na’arah bo ub’shlucho_
“A man can produce the _kiddushin_ stage of marriage for his 12.5 year old daughter, via himself or via his shaliach.”
We might ask, what is special about a 12.5 year old daughter? What would the ruling be for a 12 year old, or a 13 year old?
We can ask again, why do I need to be told he can do it himself? Here it might be less of a problem because this halacha that he can marry off his daughter is perhaps more surprising than the fact that he can marry via himself, and so maybe I do need a Mishnah to tell me both halachos.
However, even if I wouldn’t know before this Mishnah that a man can initiate the marriage process for off his 12.5 year old daughter, once you tell me he can do it with his shaliach i.e. emissary, do I have to be told that he can do it himself, or is that obvious? Again, is it typical of a Mishnah to list redundant things that can be inferred from one another, or is it surprising that it is doing so?

[Words]

* אִישׁ: The word אִישׁ means “man” in Hebrew.
It can have a connotation of an important man, as opposed to the Hebrew [[גֶּבֶר]] or [![אדם]].


* אִשָּׁה: The Hebrew word אִשָּׁה can mean “woman” or “wife.” It is the feminine version of the word [[אִישׁ]].


* אֶת: The Hebrew word אֶת can indicate the recipient of an action in Hebrew and Aramaic.
For example, הַיֶּלֶד אֹהֵב אֶת הַכֶּלֶב, _hayeled ohev es hakelev_, “the boy loves the dog.” 
If I wouldn’t have the את, it would be possible for me to misunderstand the sentence as saying “the dog loves the boy,” because Hebrew and Aramaic are not as strict about the word order of sentences.
===
> [[More]]
===

More: Specifically, אֶת is used when the recipient of the object is “definite,” e.g. it begins with ה i.e. the word “the,” meaning that we are speaking about a specific thing. If we are speaking about “a dog,” then the sentence would read הַיֶּלֶד אֹהֵב כֶּלֶב _hayeled ohev kelev_ without an אֶת.


* או: The word אוֹ is the Hebrew word for “or.”


* את: The letters את בare be several words:
- It can be the Hebrew word אֶת, which indicates the recipient of an action. [[אֶת|<small>(→)</small>]]
- It can be the Hebrew word אַתְּ, which means “you” referring to a female person.


* בַּת: The Hebrew word בַּת means “daughter.”
- It can appear with posessive suffixes such as [[בתו|בִּתּוֹ]] (_bito_, “his daughter.”)


* בה: The letters בה probabare means “in her/it,” “with her/it,” “on her/it” or “regarding her/it.” [[More|<small>(→)</small>]]
(There is a word that sounds like “ba” that means “came” but that’s spelled בָּא not בּוֹ.)

More:
The letters בה are probably the [[prefix ב]] being used to refer to a feminine entity:
- The prefix ב has [[Prefix ב#Meanings|various meanings]] including “in” and “with.”
- When followed by [[Prefix ב#בּוֹ|the suffix ה]]‎, the ב can be referencing “her” or “it.”
- So, בה can mean “in her/it,” “with her/it,” “on her/it,” “regarding her/it,” or any other combination.

The letters בה are probably the [[Prefix ב#Various suffixes|the prefix ב with the feminine singular suffix]].
- The prefix ב has [[Prefix ב#Meanings|various meanings]] including “in” and “with.”


* בו: The letters בו probably mean “in him/it,” “with him/it,” “on him/it” or “regarding him/it.” [[More|<small>(→)</small>]]
(There is a word that sounds like “bo” that means “come” but that’s spelled בּוֹא not בּוֹ.)

More:
The letters בו are probably the [[Prefix ב#suffixes|the prefix ב]] when referring to a masculine entity:
- The prefix ב has [[Prefix ב#Meanings|various meanings]] including “in” and “with.”
- When followed by [[Prefix ב#בּוֹ|the suffix ו]]‎, the ב can be referencing “him” or “it.”
- So, בו can mean “in her/it,” “with him/it,” “on him/it,” “regarding him/it,” or any other combination.


* בתו: The letters בתו are probably:
- The Hebrew word [[בַּת]], meaning daughter.
- The Hebrew suffix ו meaning “his.” ([[Hebrew Possessive Suffixes#Third person masculine singular for masculine singular noun|<small>more</small>]])
- The combination is pronounced בִּתּוֹ, _bito_.


* גֶּבֶר: גֶּבֶר is a Hebrew word for “man.” 
גֶּבֶר can denote a less significant person than the alternative Hebrew word for “man,” [[אִישׁ]].


* גברא: גברא is an Aramaic word for “man,” possibly with a connotation of a less important or praise-worthy man, as in the phrase “ההוא גברא,” i.e. “that man [did such and such],” which the Gemara sometimes uses to introduce a story about a person doing something inadvisable.


* הִיא: The Hebrew word הִיא means “she.”


* האיש:
The letters האיש only correspond to the meaning “the man.”
- It begins with the letter ה meaning “the” [[Hebrew definite article|<small>(→)</small>]]
- It continues with the [[אִישׁ]] meaning “man.”


* האשה: The letters האשה probably are:
- The Hebrew prefix ה meaning “the.” [[Hebrew definite article|<small>(→)</small>]]
- The Hebrew word [[אִשָּׁה]].


* ובשלוחה: The letters ובשלוחה can only be:
- The [[prefix ו]] meaning and/or.
- The [[prefix ב]] which has various [[Prefix ב#Meanings|meanings]], such as “in,” “with,” and “on.”
- The word [[שָׁלוּחַ]], which means “is sent” or “a person/thing that is sent.”
- The suffix ה meaning “her” or “its.” [[Hebrew Possessive Suffixes#Third person masculine singular for masculine singular noun|<small>(→)</small>]]


* ובשלוחו: The letters ובשלוחו can only mean:
- “And/or with his sent-person i.e. emissary.” [[More|<small>(→)</small>]]

More: The letters ובשלוחו can only be ו|ב|שלוח|ו:
- The [[prefix ו]], meaning and/or, pronounced “oo” when before a ב.
- The [[prefix ב]] which has various [[Prefix ב#Meanings|meanings]] including “in,” “with,” and “on,” (pronounced “b” when starting a syllable, as opposed to “v.”)
- The Hebrew word [[שָׁלוּחַ]], which can mean “is sent” or “a person/thing that is sent.” Here, because the word is followed by “his,” we see that it must mean “a person/thing that is sent.”
- The [[Hebrew Possessive Suffixes#Third person masculine singular for masculine singular noun|“possessive” suffix ו]], meaning “his” or “its.”
- Putting that all together, it means “and/or, in/with/on/etc, his/its, sent person/thing.”


* כַּאֲשֶׁר: The Hebrew word כַּאֲשֶׁר means “when.”
- It can be condensed to a prefix כש used before an event. [[Prefix כש|<small>(→)</small>]]


* כשהיא: The letters כשהיא are probably:
- The Hebrew [[prefix כש]], short for the Hebrew word [[כַּאֲשֶׁר]], meaning “when.”
- The Hebrew word [[הִיא]] meaning ‘she.’


* מְקַדֵּשׁ: The word מְקַדֵּשׁ _mekadesh_ can be identified as follows [[Identifying verbs|<small>(?)</small>]]:
- It is a type of word called an active participle, meaning it describes an action that is ongoing or habitual (e.g. he runs/is running.) [[active participle|<small>(→)</small>]]
- It comes from the root or shoresh קדש, meaning holiness. (More: [[Shoresh קדש]], [[shoresh]])


* מִקְדָּשׁ: The word מִקְדָּשׁ means sanctuary or holy place, from the [[shoresh קדש]].


* מקדש: The letters מקדש could be one of several words:
- It could be the word מְקַדֵּשׁ _mekadesh_, meaning “makes/is making holy” [[מְקַדֵּשׁ|<small>(→)</small>]]
- It could be the word מְקַדֵּשׁ _mikdash_, meaning sanctuary [[מִקְדָּשׁ|<small>(→)</small>]]
- It could be [[the {{prefix מ}}]] meaning “from,” followed by some place or person spelled קדש, as in וַיִּסְעוּ מִקָּדֵשׁ (_vayisu m’kadesh_, “they traveled from Kadesh,” Bamidbar 20:22.)


* מתקדשת: The letters מתקדשת are the Hebrew word מִתְקַדֶּשֶׁת:
- The word מִתְקַדֶּשֶׁת can mean “she makes herself holy.”
===
> [[More]]
===

More:
The Hebrew word מִתְקַדֶּשֶׁת can be identified as follows [[Identifying verbs|<small>(?)</small>]]:
- The מת prefix indicates it is an adjective or verb called an [[active participle]] which describes an ongoing action, such as “runs” or “is running.”
- The מת prefix also indicates it is a [[“hispa’el”]] verb, which is the Hebrew [[reflexive]], indicating an action that affects or transforms the doer.
- The ת suffix indicates a singular feminine verb, indicating a single feminine doer of the action.
- The letters קדש in the middle of a word must be root letters, identifying the shoresh as [[shoresh {קדש}]], which produces words related to “holiness.”
- Putting these all together, מִתְקַדֶּשֶׁת might mean “she makes herself holy.” This can also be a technical term for a woman who becomes halachically engaged to a man for marriage.


* נַעֲרָה: The Hebrew word נַעֲרָה means “young woman.”
In halachah, נַעֲרָה can be a technical term for a girl of a specific age. The term קְטַנָּה (_katana_) generally refers to a girl below the age of 12. From 12 to 12.5 years of age, she is called a נַעֲרָה (_na’ara_.) After 12.5 years, she becomes a בּוֹגֶרֶת (_bogeres_,) indicating legal adulthood. These definitions are general and may be contested or inapplicable depending on the given context.
Less commonly, נערה could be the word נער, “young man,” followed by the possessive suffix הּ meaning “her,” as in, “her young man.”


* נערה: The letters נערה are probably the Hebrew word נַעֲרָה, meaning “young woman.” [[נַעֲרָה|<small>(→)</small>]]


* שָׁלוּחַ: The Hebrew word שָׁלוּחַ (_shaluach_) has various meanings:
- It can mean “is sent” as in המכתב שלוח, (_hamichtav shaluach_, “the letter is sent.”)
- It can mean “something or someone who is sent” such as a messenger, (הַשָּׁלוּחַ, _hashaluach_, “the one who is sent.”)
===

More:
The Hebrew word שָׁלוּחַ can be identified as follows [[Identifying verbs|<small>(?)</small>]]:
- The word שלוח comes from the [[shoresh שלח]]
- Grammatically, it is a [[passive participle]]
- It comes from binyan [[pa’al]].
- See [[{|regular conjugations for }pa’al passive participle{ for Regular Shorushim|s}]].


* שלוח: The letters שלוח represent the Hebrew word שָׁלוּחַ meaning “is sent” or “someone or something that is sent.” [[שָׁלוּחַ|<small>(→)</small>]]
