* Construct state:
In many languages there is a way of combining two nouns to produce a combination noun.
- For example, in English I can say something is "The Bank Headquarters" and use "Bank" as an adjective even though it is a noun.
- Common phrases like "post office" and "police station" use this construct form.
- The construct form is called the "smichus" סמיכות in traditional grammar.
- The construct form is contrasted with the absolute form, which is just a regular noun like “the apple.”


* How to identify verbs in Hebrew and Aramaic: This is what you need to know to identify a verb in Hebrew and Aramaic:
- Every verb comes from a [[shoresh]].
- A shoresh gets put into a [[“binyan”]] which produces a verb, which might have several possible meanings. If you can figure out the shoresh and binyan, that will narrow down the action being spoken about to a few possibilities, but we still wont know who is doing the action, or when.
- Next we try to determine [[“tenses” of Hebrew and Aramaic|the tense of the verb]], like the [[future tense]] or [[past tense]].
- Next we try to determine the “person” of the verb, eg first-person (“I run”) or “second-person” (“you run”), etc.
- So, when we see a verb in the Gemara, we want to identify the shoresh, the binyan, the tense, and the person.


* Strong letters: In Hebrew and Aramaic, some letters are considered “strong” in that if they are part of a [[shoresh]] then they will appear in all verbs formed from that shoresh.
- Strong letters are those that are not [[weak letters]].


* Verb forms beginning with ה:
There are several verb forms in Hebrew that begin with a ה prefix:
- The [[{hifil past tense} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., הִבְדִּיל, _hivdil,_ “he separated.”)
- The [[{hifil imperative} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., הַבְדֵּל, _havdeil,_ “separate!”)
There are no major forms in Aramaic that begin with ה because the Aramaic equivalent of the hifil ie [[afel]] begins with א instead.


* Verb forms beginning with מ:
There are [[several {{Hebrew verb forms beginning with מ}}]], and [[several {{Aramaic verb forms beginning with מ}}]].


* Vowel shift for ח and ע: When ח or ע are after a vowel sound like “ei,” sometimes a second vowel sound “ah” is added.
- For example, the [[_pa’al_ active participle for regular shorushim]] has an “ei” vowel sound, eg כּוֹתֵב (_koseiv_, he is writing.)
- However, the [[pa’al active participle for shorushim ending with ח or ע]] has two vowel sounds, eg פּוֹתֵחַ (_posei-ach_, he is opening.)
- Some linguists bring this as [[evidence for the shift of the pronunciation of these letters]].

Evidence for the shift of the pronunciation of these letters:
Some linguists bring vowel changes for shorushim ending in ח or ע as evidence for a shift in their pronunciation:
- We generally pronounce ח like we do כ, and ע like we do א.
- However, some linguists point to the fact that “gutteral” letters like ח or ע receive an “extra” vowel sound (_po-say-ach_ as opposed to, e.g. _kos-eiv)_ as evidence that the original sounds of ח and ע were different from כ and א.
- The real sound for a ח or ע might have been so low in the throat, that the jaw would need to open fully to pronounce them, causing the vowel shift from “ei” to “ah.”
- This is as opposed to the כ or א letters which are similar to ח and ע but which are pronounced at the back of the mouth, without opening the throat, and can therefore accomidate an “ei” vowel, eg הוֹלֵךְ (_holeich_, [he] is walking), or בּוֹרֵא (_borei_, [he] is creating.)


* Weak letters: In Hebrew and Aramaic, some letters are considered “weak” in that it is not clear if they are part of a word’s [[shoresh]] or whether they are added as vowels or part of a conjugation. Sometimes, weak letters act as consonants, and are pronounced strongly.
- The weak letters are ‎א, ‎ע, ‎ה, ‎ח, ‎י, ‎ו, and ‎נ.
- Letters that are not weak are [[strong letters]].


* Word-order in Hebrew and Aramaic:
Hebrew and Aramaic have different word-order rules than English:
- In English, you almost always have a subject, then a verb, then an object, eg “The man eats the apple.”
- In Hebrew and Aramaic, these rules are more flexible.
- The existence of the direct object marker את allows the object to precede the subject more easily than in English.
- E.g, את התפוח אוכל האיש, "the apple, the man eats" is perfectly valid Hebrew but is awkward in English.
- Keep a heads up when reading Rishonim like Rashi and Tosofos that sentences frequently begin with a verb or object rather than the subject.


[Dikduk/Aramaic]

* Aramaic definite article:
The Aramaic definite article is a grammatical entity in the Aramaic language.
- Most languages have a concept called [[definite article]].
- In Aramaic, the definite article is an א suffix after a noun, usually vowelized אָ, _au_.
- Sometimes Aramaic uses the א suffix in situations that we wouldn’t use the word “the” in English, for difficult to understand reasons.
- Hebrew also has a [[Hebrew {definite article}]], but it is a ה prefix, like הַמֶלֶךְ (_hamelech,_ “the king.”)


* Aramaic verb forms beginning with מ:
Several of the [[verb forms beginning with מ]] are from Aramaic:
- The Aramaic [[{pa’el active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מְזַמֵּן, _mezamen,_ “he is inviting.”)
- The Hebrew [[{ispe’el active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מִי(תְ)מְסֵיר, _mi(s’)m’seir,_ “he is being handed over.”)
- The Hebrew [[{ispa’al active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מִ(תְ)קַדַשׁ, _mi(s)kadash_ “he is being sanctified.”)
- The Hebrew [[{itaf’al active participle} for regular shorushim]] (e.g., מִיתַּפְקַד, _mitafkad_ “he is being deposited.”)


* Pronoun suffixes: In Aramaic, words in the [[participle]] can have what are called “pronoun suffixes”:
- Words like “running” which are called “participles” require a pronoun like “I” to clarify who is doing the action, eg “I am running.”
- In Aramaic, we can attach the pronoun to the end of the verb, for example, כְּתֵיב (_kseiv_) means “writing,” אֲנָא (_anau_) means “I,” and the two together, כָּתֵיבְנָא (_kauseivna_) means “I am writing.”
- (As in a regular sentence, combining a pronoun like “I” with an [[active participle]] forms the [[present tense]].)
- These are the Aramaic words that get added as suffixes:
| ‎אֲנָא ‎ <br><br> _anau_ <br><br><br> I | ‎אַתְּ‎ <br><br> _at_ <br><br><br> You [man or woman] |
| ‎אֲנַן‎ <br><br> _anan_ <br><br><br> We | ‎אַתּוּ/ן‎ <br><br> _atu/n_ <br><br><br> You [men or women] |


[Dikduk/Aramaic/Binyanim]

* Aramaic binyanim: There six binyanim in Aramaic. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
| *Aramaic* | [[Simple]] | [[Intensive]] | [[Causative]] |
| [[Active]]  | [[_Pe’al_]] | [[_Pa’el_]] | [[_Af’el_]] |
| [[Passive]] / [[Reflexive]] | [[_Ispe’el_]] | [[_Ispa’al_]] | [[_Itaf’al_]] |
The binyanim of Aramaic mostly align with the [[Hebrew binyanim]].


[Dikduk/Aramaic/Binyanim/Af’el]

* Af’el: The “Af’el” (אַפְעֵל) is one of the [[Aramaic binyanim]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a special concept in Hebrew and Aramaic grammar]].)
- A verb in the _af’el_ often has a meaning of making someone else take on properties of the [[shoresh]].
- For example, the shoresh שמע means “hearing or understanding,” and the _af’el_ verb אַשְׁמַע means “to make someone else hear or understand,” ie to teach.
- Advanced students can [[learn more about the _af’el_]].
