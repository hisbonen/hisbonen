בה:
The letters בה are probably the prefix ב being used to refer to a feminine entity:
- The prefix ב has various meanings including “in” and “with.” <small>{{[[Prefix ב#Meanings|→]]}}</small>
- When followed by the suffix ה‎, the ב can be referencing “her” or “it.” <small>{{[[Prefix ב#בָּהּ|→]]}}</small>
- So, בה can mean “in her/it,” “with her/it,” “on her/it,” “regarding her/it,” or any other combination.
(There is a word that sounds like _“ba”_ that means “comes” or “came” but that’s spelled בָּא not בַּהּ.)
