נַעֲרָה: The Hebrew word נַעֲרָה means “young woman.”
In halachah, נַעֲרָה can be a technical term for a girl of a specific age. The term קְטַנָּה (_katana_) generally refers to a girl below the age of 12. From 12 to 12.5 years of age, she is called a נַעֲרָה (_na’ara_.) After 12.5 years, she becomes a בּוֹגֶרֶת (_bogeres_,) indicating legal adulthood. These definitions are general and may be contested or inapplicable depending on the given context.
Less commonly, נערה could be the word נער, “young man,” followed by the possessive suffix הּ meaning “her,” as in, “her young man.”
