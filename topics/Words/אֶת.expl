אֶת: The Hebrew word אֶת can indicate the recipient of an action in Hebrew and Aramaic.
For example, הַיֶּלֶד אֹהֵב אֶת הַכֶּלֶב, _hayeled ohev es hakelev_, “the boy loves the dog.” 
If I wouldn’t have the את, it would be possible for me to misunderstand the sentence as saying “the dog loves the boy,” because Hebrew and Aramaic are not as strict about the word order of sentences.

More: Specifically, אֶת is used when the recipient of the object is “definite,” e.g. it begins with ה i.e. the word “the,” meaning that we are speaking about a specific thing. If we are speaking about “a dog,” then the sentence would read הַיֶּלֶד אֹהֵב כֶּלֶב _hayeled ohev kelev_ without an אֶת.
