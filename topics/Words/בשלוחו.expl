בשלוחו: The letters בשלוחו _u’b’shlucho_ probably:
- The [[prefix ו]], meaning and/or, pronounced “oo” when before a ב.
- The [[prefix ב]] which has various [[Prefix ב#Meanings|meanings]] including “in,” “with,” and “on,” (pronounced “b” when starting a syllable, as opposed to “v.”)
- The Hebrew word [[שָׁלוּחַ]], which can mean “is sent” or “a person/thing that is sent.” Here, because the word is followed by “his,” we see that it must mean “a person/thing that is sent.”
- The [[Hebrew Possessive Suffixes#Third-person masculine singular for masculine singular noun|“possessive” suffix ו]], meaning “his” or “its.”
- Putting that all together, it means “and/or, in/with/on/etc, his/its, sent person/thing.”
