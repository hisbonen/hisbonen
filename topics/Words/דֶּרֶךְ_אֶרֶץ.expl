דֶּרֶךְ אֶרֶץ: The Hebrew phrase דֶּרֶךְ אֶרֶץ _derech eretz_ “way of the land” has several connotations:
- It can mean that something is appropriate or polite
- It can also refer to working to support oneself financially
- It is used in the name of a minor tractate of Talmud Bavli called דרך ארץ רבה, _derech eretz rabah_ which discusses proper behavior.
