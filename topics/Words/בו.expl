בו:
The letters בו are probably the [[Prefix ב#suffixes|the prefix ב]] when referring to something masculine:
- The prefix ב has various meanings including “in” and “with.” <small>{{[[Prefix ב#Meanings|→]]}}</small>
- When followed by the suffix ו, the ב can be referencing “him” or “it.” <small>{{[[Prefix ב#בּוֹ|→]]}}</small>
- So, בו can mean “in her/it,” “with him/it,” “on him/it,” “regarding him/it,” or any other combination.
(There is a word that sounds like “bo” that means “come” but that’s spelled בּוֹא not בּוֹ.)
