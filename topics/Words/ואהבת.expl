ואהבת: The letters ואהבת are probably:
- The [[prefix ו]] meaning and/or
- The Hebrew word אַהֲבָת meaning “you loved” <small>{{[[אַהֲבָת|→]]}}</small>
- It might be part of the famous _pasuk_ וְאָהַבְתָּ לְרֵעֲךָ כָּמוֹךָ _v’ahavta l’reicha kemocha_, in which case the ו is a [[“conversive ו”]] which would flip the meaning from “you loved” to “you will love.”
