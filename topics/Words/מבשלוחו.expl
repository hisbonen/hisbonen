מבשלוחו: The letters מבשלוחו probably are a Hebrew construction מִבְּשִׁלוּחוֹ _m’b’shlucho_ meaning “from/than via his messenger” <small>{{[[More|→]]}}</small>

More:
- The prefix מ meaning “from” or “than” (as in, greater “than.”) <small>{{[[Prefix מ|→]]}}</small>
- The [[prefix ב]] which has various [[Prefix ב#Meanings|meanings]] including “in,” “with,” and “on,” (pronounced “b” when starting a syllable, as opposed to “v.”)
- The Hebrew word [[שָׁלוּחַ]], which can mean “is sent” or “a person/thing that is sent.” Here, because the word is followed by “his,” we see that it must mean “a person/thing that is sent.”
- The [[Hebrew Possessive Suffixes#Third-person masculine singular for masculine singular noun|“possessive” suffix ו]], meaning “his” or “its.”
