אֵת: The Hebrew word אֵת is the Hebrew direct object pronoun.
- Every language must clarify who is doing the action and who the action is being done to.
- In English, we use word order to convey this. So, “the man at the apple” is clear because the doer is always before the verb.
- Semetic languges however allow the doer to be mentioned after the verb, such as אוכל את תפוח אדם (_ochel es tapuach adam_, "eats )
