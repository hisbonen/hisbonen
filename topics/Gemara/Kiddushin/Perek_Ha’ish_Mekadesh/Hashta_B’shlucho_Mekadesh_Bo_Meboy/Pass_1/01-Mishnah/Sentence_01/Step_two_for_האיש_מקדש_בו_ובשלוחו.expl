Step two for האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו:
The text begins with a Mishnah, let’s learn the first clause:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[Parts|Let’s go]]

Parts:
Let’s clarify context, and then translate the clause and ask comprehension questions.

Translation:
Let’s identify the first clause, translate the words, then translate the whole clause.
===
1. [[Identify clause]]
2. [[Translate words]]
3. [[Translate clause]]
===

Identify clause:
This is the full text of the Mishnah:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו האשה
< מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש
< מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
How do we know where the first clause of the Mishnah ends?
===
> [[Identify clause 2|How?]]
===

Identify clause 2:
We can see a repetition of similar-looking words:
< *האיש מקדש* בו ובשלוחו *האשה
< מתקדשת* בה ובשלוחה *האיש
< מקדש* את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[Identify clause 3|I see a pattern!]]
===

Identify clause 3:
Great! Now we can see the Mishnah has three parts, and we’ll focus on the first one:
< *[האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו]* האשה
< מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש
< מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[#Translate Words]]

Translate Words:
Let’s translate the individual words of the clause, then the clause as a whole:
<==
- [[1. {{האיש}}]]
- [[2. {{מקדש}}]]
- [[3. {{בו}}]]
- [[4. {{ובשלוחו}}]]

האיש:
Let’s translate the word האיש in the first clause of the Mishnah:
< *האיש* מקדש בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[Ha'ish 2|Okay]]
===

Ha'ish 2:
How might we figure out the meaning of the word “האיש”?
===
> [[Ha'ish 3|How]]
> [[#Ha'ish 5|Just tell me]]
===

Ha'ish 3:
We see that the first letter is ה, which tips us off to the fact that “האיש” is probably:
1. A noun starting with the word “the” which is a ה prefix in Hebrew ([[Hebrew definite article|More]])
2. A Hebrew past-tense verb, which can start with ה ([[Verb forms beginning with ה|More]])
3. ה is the start of a name or standalone word in the dictionary.
(You can see a longer list of possibilities [[ה at the start of a word|here]].)
===
> [[Ha'ish 4|Ok]]
===

Ha'ish 4:
If ה is a prefix meaning “the” and not part of the underlying word, then the rest of the letters איש should be a word we can find in the dictionary, and they are:
- [איש in the Klein dictionary](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%90%D6%B4%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%81.1)
- [איש in the Jastrow dictionary](https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%90%D6%B4%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%81)
===
> [[Ha'ish 5|Ok]]
===

Ha'ish 5:
We can also tell האיש isn't a verb if we recognize there are no verb forms that would produce a word with that spelling. ([[Ha'ish 5-A|More]])
===
> [[Ha'ish 6|Ok]]
===

Ha'ish 5-A:
This is because even though there is [[Hebrew binyanim/Hifil|a Hebrew verb form that start with ה]], there happens to be no [[shoresh]] that would produce a conjugation with the spelling “האיש.”
- Now, you might think that if there would be a [[shoresh]] with a weak first letter like נאש, maybe putting that shoresh into a form called [[the {{hifil past tense}}]] could indeed produce a conjugation that would be spelled “האיש.”
- This is because the ה prefix of the [[hifil]] sometimes causes weak letters to drop off the front of a shoresh, eg how adding a ה to the shoresh נפל would produce the conjugation הִפִּיל, “he fell.”
- However, this dropping of נ only occurs if the letter after the נ can take a dagesh, (a dot in the middle of the letter that can indicate a doubled sound,) because the נ is sort of being compressed into a doubling of the sound of the second letter. For example, putting נפל into the [[hifil past tense]] should really produce הִנְפִּיל, _hinpil_, but that is hard to pronounce and so gets simplified to הִפִּיל _hip-pil_ ie turning the נ into a doubling of the פ by adding a dagesh to the פ.
- In our theoretical example of the shoresh נאש producing the conjugation האיש, the second shoresh letter would be א which cannot take a dagesh ie cannot be doubled in this way, and so the נ would always remain visible, and so there is no such shoresh that when put in the [[hifil]] could produce the spelling האיש.
===
> [[#Ha'ish 5|Ok]]
===

Ha'ish 6:
*So:* literally “האיש” _ha’ish_ means “the man.”
===
> [[Ha'ish 7|Ok]]
===

Ha'ish 7:
Great, that's all for now. You can move on to the next word, or skip to the clause-translation.

מקדש:
Let’s translate the word מקדש in the first clause of the Mishnah:
< האיש *מקדש* בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[Mekadesh 2|Great!]]
===

Mekadesh 2:
How could you figure out yourself what it means?
===
> [[Mekadesh 3|How?]]
> [[#Mekadesh 17|Just tell me]]
===

Mekadesh 3:
First we might notice that the word begins with מ. Given that the Mishnah is in Hebrew, that should tip us off that it could be:
1. The Hebrew prefix מ before a noun, usually meaning “from.” [[prefix מ|(More)]]
1. Some Hebrew verb conjugation formed by adding מ to a [[shoresh]]. ([[Hebrew verb forms beginning with מ|More]])
2. Some style of Hebrew noun that adds a מ before a [[shoresh]]. ([[Noun patterns that begin with מ|More]])
===
> [[Mekadesh 4|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 4:
Now, we also have to be careful, because there may be multiple words that are spelled מקדש, and so more than one of those options might correspond to real words.
===
> [[Mekadesh 5|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 5:
If we assume the מ in front of מקדש is some kind of prefix, we are left with קדש which are three strong letters, suggesting that the [[shoresh]] of the word could be קדש. [[Strong letters|(More)]]
===
> [[Mekadesh 6|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 6:
If we look up the shoresh קדש in the dictionary we will find that it is indeed a real shoresh, related to the idea of "holiness."
- [See קדש in Klein](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%81.1)
- [See קדש in Jastrow](https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%A7%D6%B8%D7%93%D6%B7%D7%A9%D7%81.1)
===
> [[Mekadesh 7|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 7:
Maybe מ is [[the {{prefix מ}}]] meaning “from”? But then the letters קדש after the מ would have to be a place or person for that to make sense and we don't find any such word in the dictionary.
- [See קדש in Klein](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%81.1)
- [See קדש in Jastrow](https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%A7%D6%B8%D7%93%D6%B7%D7%A9%D7%81.1)
===
> [[Mekadesh 8|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 8:
Now, even if we recognize the shoresh is קדש, and the מ is part of some kind of conjugation, we’re still not sure if this is a noun or a verb.
===
> [[Mekadesh 9|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 9:
If מקדש is a verb, we can look at the five Hebrew verb forms that start with מ, and see if any of them fit this spelling:
- מְקַדֵּשׁ, _mekadeish,_ “he makes holy/creates _kiddushin_” [[pi’el active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מְקוּדָּשׁ, _mekudash_ “he/it is made holy, receives _kiddushin_ status” [[pu’al active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מַקְדִּישׁ, _makdish_ “he sets aside for a holy purpose” [[hif’il active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מוּקְדָּשׁ, _mukdash,_ “it is set aside for holy purpose” [[huf’al active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מִתְקַדֵּשׁ, _miskadeish_ “he makes himself holy” [[hispa’el active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
===
> [[Mekadesh 10|Ok]]
===

Mekadesh 10:
Verbs in the Mishnah appear without vowel marks but often are spelled with extra letters to indicate vowels, and we're looking for the word in our Mishnah, מקדש:
- מקדש, _mekadeish,_ “he makes holy/creates _kiddushin_” [[pi’el active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מקודש, _mekudash_ “he/it is made holy, receives _kiddushin_ status” [[pu’al active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מקדיש, _makdish_ “he sets aside for a holy purpose” [[hif’il active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מוקדש, _mukdash,_ “it is set aside for holy purpose” [[huf’al active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מתקדש, _miskadeish_ “he makes himself holy” [[hispa’el active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
===
> [[Mekadesh 11|I see a match]]
===

Mekadesh 11:
Great, we should notice that only one verb form produces a word spelled מקדש, namely מְקַדֵּשׁ, which either means “he creates holiness” or is a technical term that means “he creates the _kiddushin_ stage prior to marriage”
- So, if מקדש here is a verb, it is probably מְקַדֵּשׁ meaning "he creates _kiddushin_."
===
> [[Mekadesh 12|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 12:
Now, are we sure that מקדש is actually a verb? We can check the dictionary and see if there are any nouns spelled that way.
- [מקדש in Klein dictionary](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%3C_%D8%10E%D7%B5%D8%A8%D7%B1%D8%94%D7%B6%D7%BC%D8%A10%D8%82.2)
- [מקדש in Jastrow dictionary](https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%3C_%D8%10E%D7%B5%D8%A8%D7%B1%D8%94%D7%B9%D7%BC%D8%A10%D8%82.2)
===
> [[Mekadesh 13|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 13:
Great, so we actually find that there is also a noun spelled מקדש,‎ “מִקְדָּשׁ,” _mikdash_, meaning “sanctuary.” So, מקדש could be a noun.
===
> [[Mekadesh 14|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 14:
But, let’s remember that we are in Maseches Kiddushin, which speaks about how a man produces the _kiddushin_ stage prior to marriage. So, it makes more sense to say מקדש is the verb מְקַדֵּשׁ, _mekadesh_, meaning “he creates _kiddushin_,” like we said earlier.
===
> [[Mekadesh 15|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 15:
Additionally, we already saw a noun in the sentence, “האיש”, so it makes sense that what would come next is a verb as opposed to another noun. [[Mekadesh 15-A|(More)]]
===
> [[Mekadesh 16|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 15-A:
Actually, just because we already saw a noun doesn't necessarily mean the next word will be a verb.
- You could have two nouns back-to-back in a form called the [[construct state]]
- You also have [[more flexible {{word-order in Hebrew and Aramaic}}]] so even in a simple sentence there's no guarantee the verb would be next.
- However, the fact that we already saw a noun does at least make it more likely that a verb is going to be one of the next few words.
===
> [[#Mekadesh 15|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 16:
*Great:* So we've settled on the word מקדש being the Hebrew verb מְקַדֵּשׁ, in its meaning of “he produces/is producing kiddushin,” and for those interested, we identified [[Mekadesh 16-A|its precise grammatical form]].
===
> [[Mekadesh 17|Great]]
===

Mekadesh 16-A:
The verb מְקַדֵּשׁ is the masculine third-person form of the [[pi’el active participle]], which is the [[active participle]] form of the [[Hebrew binyanim/{pi’el}{| binyan}]] - ([[What's a {{binyan}}?]])

Mekadesh 17:
Sounds good. Now you can move on to the next word in the clause בו, or skip to translating the clause as a whole.
===
> [[#בו|Next:<br>Translate בו]]
> [[#Translate Clause|Continue:<br>Translate Clause]]
===

בו:
Let’s translate the word בו in the first clause of the Mishnah:
< האיש מקדש *בו* ובשלוחו
===
> [[Bo 2|Great!]]
===

Bo 2:
How could you figure out what בו means yourself?
===
> [[Bo 3|How]]
> [[#Bo 8|Just tell me]]
===

Bo 3:
So, you might know that there is a word “bo” that means “come” or “comes,” but, that word is always spelled with an א as in בא or בוא, so that can't be what בו means.
===
> [[Bo 4|Okay]]
===

Bo 4:
So, you might also know that that there is a prefix ב that comes before the names of things and can mean in/with/for/on/at, and a few other options. For example, _babayis_, בֶּבַּיִת, means “in the house.”
- You can see the full list [[Prefix ב#Meanings|here]]
===
> [[Bo 5|Okay]]
===

Bo 5:
Additionally, the prefix ב can be combined with various suffixes to form a standalone word.
- A ו after a prefix usually means “him/it.”
- So בו would mean with/in/at/for + _*him/it*_
- [[Prefix ב#Various suffixes|See all suffixes of prefix ב]]
===
> [[Bo 6|Okay]]
===

Bo 6:
Great, so now at least we know what word it is, the prefix ב with a suffix meaning “him/it,” we just don’t know which meaning of ב it is, ie with/in/at/for etc.
===
> [[Bo 7|Okay]]
===

Bo 7:
So, how can we figure out what ב means here? We can go through the list of possible meanings and see which ones fit.
- The man makes kiddushin *in* himself ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *at* himself ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *on* himself ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *because of* himself ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *along with* himself ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *via* himself 🤔
- The man makes kiddushin *for* himself 🤔
===
> [[Bo 8|Okay]]
===

Bo 8:
*Okay so:* we might not actually have enough information at this point to figure out the exact meaning, so for now, we’ll translate בו as “with/for himself.”
===
> [[Bo 9|Okay]]
===

Bo 9:
Great! You can continue to the translation of the next word, or of the clause as a whole.
===
> [[#ובשלוחו|Next:<br>Translate ובשלוחו]]
> [[#Translate Clause|Continue:<br>Translate Clause]]
===

ובשלוחו:
Let’s translate the word ובשלוחו in the first clause of the Mishnah:
< האיש מקדש בו *ובשלוחו*
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 2|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 2:
How could you figure out yourself what ובשלוחו means?
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 3|How?]]
> [[#U’b’shlucho 39|Just tell me]]
===

U’b’shlucho 3:
So, we’re looking at the last word of the first clause of the Mishnah.
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
To recap:
- We saw that האיש probably means “the man”
- We saw מקדש probably means “makes kiddushin”
- We saw בו probably means “via/for” + “him/it.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 4|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 4:
So now, lets analyze the word ובשלוחו.
< האיש מקדש בו *ובשלוחו*
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 5|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 5:
The first thing that should jump out at us is that a ו at the beginning of a word is almost always a prefix meaning “and/or.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 6|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 6:
Lets look at the word again: ובשלוחו. If we remove the first ו, we are left with בשלוחו.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 7|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 7:
Almost all words in Hebrew and Aramaic are formed from [[shoresh|roots that appear to be two or three letters]], so we should keep an eye out for letters that could be part of a word's root.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 8|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 8:
[[Strong letters]] are more likely to be part of a word's root. Here, we see four strong letters, ב, ‎ש, ‎ל, and ‎ח.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 9|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 9:
Four letters are usually too many to be part of one [[shoresh]]. [[Four-letter shorushim|(More)]]
- So, one of the letters בשלח is probably a prefix or suffix.
- There is no such suffix as ח, so the first letter ב is probably a prefix and not part of the word itself.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 10|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 10:
It makes a lot of sense that ב would be a prefix, because we know there is [[a {{prefix ב}}]], and we just saw it recently in the previous word, בו.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 11|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 11:
So, lets assume ב is a prefix.
- We started with ובשלוחו
- Then, we said the first ו was either “and” or “or.”
- Then, we just said that the next ב is [[the {{prefix ב}}]], and that can mean in/at/on/along with/via/for etc.
- So, if we remove the first two letters of ובשלוחו, ie the letters וב, we are left with שלוחו.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 12|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 12:
We said that a [[shoresh]] usually has three [[strong letters]], and in the word שלוחו we find ‎ש, ‎ל, and ‎ח which are three strong letters.
- So, looking at our word שלוחו, it would seem שלח is our shoresh, and the two ו letters are extra.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 13|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 13:
So, if our shoresh is שלח, let’s take a moment to look it up and see what it means.
- [שלח in Klein](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%A9%D7%81%D7%9C%D7%97_%E1%B4%B5.1)
- [שלח in Jastrow](https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%A9%D6%B8%D7%81%D7%9C%D6%B7%D7%97.1)
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 14|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 14:
So, we see that in general the shoresh שלח has connotations of sending something or someone.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 15|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 15:
So, if our shoresh is שלח, and we’re looking at שלוחו, then that means we’re seeing two extra instances of the letter ו, one at the end of the word and one between the ל and ח.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 16|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 16:
Now, a ו at the end of a word can mean a lot of things, and due to its position at the end of the word, it is more likely to be some kind of add-on, so let’s ignore the last ו for the moment and focus on the ו in the middle, של[*ו*]חו.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 17|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 17:
So, because our shoresh is שלח and the ו is occuring between letters two and three of the shoresh, let’s ask, are there any standard types of word that usually have a ו there?
- The answer is, there are only two common types of word in Hebrew or Aramaic that insert a ו between the second and third shoresh letters.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 18|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 18:
The first possibility is a type of word that represents the result of a finished action. For example:
- The shoresh שרף is means burning, and the word שָׂרוּף means “burnt.”
- The shoresh אמר is means speech, and the word אָמוּר means something is “said.”
- The shoresh אכל is means eating, and the word אָכוּל means something is “eaten.”
- [[U’b’shlucho 18-A|(Learn more about this word form)]]
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 19|Great!]]
===

U’b’shlucho 18-A:
Words like שָׂרוּף or אָמוּר act as adjectives and represent a finished action.
- First, you'll need to know what a [[shoresh]], [[binyan]], and [[tense]] is.
- These words belong to a special tense called [[the {{passive participle}}]].
- In Hebrew, only the [[Hebrew binyanim/Pa’al|pa’al binyan]] has this form.
- You can learn more about the [[pa’al passive participle]].

U’b’shlucho 19:
So:
- If our shoresh is שלח which means “sending,”
- And, putting a ו between the second and third letters can signify a finished action,
- Then, if we put such a ו in our shoresh, ie שלוח, what might the resulting word mean?
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 20|What?]]
===

U’b’shlucho 20:
The resulting word might be, “sent,” as in, something is sent.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 21|Great]]
===

U’b’shlucho 21:
Wonderful, so the first possible meaning of שלוח is “sent.” It would be pronounced שָׁלוּחַ, ie _shaluach_. [[Vowel shift for ח and ע|(More)]]
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 22|Great]]
===

U’b’shlucho 22:
Now, the other type of word that puts a ו between letters two and three of the shoresh is a type of noun. For example:
- The shoresh לבש relates to dress, and the word לְבוּשׁ, _levush_, means “clothing.”
- The shoresh יצר relates to creation, and the word יְצוּר, _yetzur_, means “creature.”
- [[Katul noun pattern|(More info)]]
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 23|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 23:
However, this type of noun has a vowel called a _sheva_ under the first letter, for example לְבוּשׁ, and when we look up שלוח, we don't find any such vowelization for this shoresh.
- [שלוח in Klein](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%A9%D6%B8%D7%81%D7%9C%D6%BD%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%97%D6%B7.1)
- [שלוח in Jastrow](https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%A9%D6%B8%D7%81%D7%9C%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%97%D6%B7.1)
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 24|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 24:
So, we can conclude that שלוח here is the type of word that represents a finished action, ie “sent.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 25|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 25:
However, there is one last wrinkle, which is that adjectives in Hebrew and Aramaic are a bit more flexible than in English.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 26|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 26:
So, even if we know that שלוח means “sent,” in Hebrew and Aramaic, adjectives can generally be translated in three ways:
- שלוח can be an adjective, as in הוא היה *שלוח*, _hu haya *shaluach*_, “he was *sent*.”
- שלוח can act as a present tense verb, as in הוא *שלוח*, _hu *shaluach*_, “he *is sent*.”
- שלוח can be a noun, as in שלוח בא, _shaluach ba_, “a sent thing/person is coming”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 27|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 27:
So, we see that שלוח has something to do with the adjective “sent,” but we're not sure how it is functioning in this sentence.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 28|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 28:
Let’s zoom out and look at the ו at the end we ignored temporarily. Our word was שלוחו. Given that we now think “שלוח” has to do with the word “sent,” we can use that information to narrow down the possibilities as to what the ו at the end might mean.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 29|Exciting]]
===

U’b’shlucho 29:
So, let’s ask in general, what are the common meanings of a ו at the end of a word?
- We a וּ at the end of many past-tense plural verbs, like כָּתְבוּ _katvu_, “they wrote.”
- We וּ at the end of many plural command verbs, like כִּתְבוּ, _kitvu_, “write, you all!”
- We find a וֹ or יו at the end of some nouns, meaning “his.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 30|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 30:
So, putting all this together, if we think שלוח has to do with the adjective “sent,” then it doesn't make sense to think that the final ו is part of a verb conjugation, because שלוח itself is a fully conjugated word form and can't be combined with either of the verb forms we just mentioned.
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 31|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 31:
So, only one of the three ו meanings we listed seems to fit:
- We find a וֹ or יו at the end of some nouns, meaning “his.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 32|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 32:
So, to recap, we're trying to figure out what the ו and the end of שלוחו means.
- We identified that שלוח was the word “sent,” but mentioned that this type of word can be used either as an adjective, “sent,” or as a verb, “is sent,” or as a noun, “someone/something that is sent.”
- We identified three common meanings of a ו at the end of a word, but two of them were parts of verb forms that wouldn't make sense coming after the word שלוח
- That left us with the third meaning of a final ו, a suffix that can come after a noun that would mean “his/its.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 33|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 33:
So, perhaps you noticed that one of the possible meanings of שלוח is a noun, “someone/something that is sent,” and the only possible meaning here of the final ו is a suffix that would come after a noun, meaning “his/its.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 34|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 34:
So, put those things together, and we can translate שלוחו as “his/its someone/something that is sent.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 35|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 35:
Now, let’s try to think of what sorts of real-life things might get called “someone/something that is sent.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 36|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 36:
If שלוח means “something that is sent,” it could mean “package” or “delivery,” because those are things that are sent.
- Alternatively, if it means “someone who is sent”, that could refer to a “messenger” or “emissary,” because those are people who “are sent.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 37|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 37:
Now, our full word was ובשלוחו, so lets go back and see if we can find a meaning of ב that fits:
- The man makes kiddushin *in* himself and/or his sent thing/person ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *at* himself and/or his sent thing/person ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *on* himself and/or his sent thing/person ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *because of* himself and/or his sent thing/person ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *along with* himself and/or his sent thing/person ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *via* himself and/or his sent thing/person 🤔
- The man makes kiddushin *for* himself and/or his sent thing/person 🤔
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 38|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 38:
*So:* putting that all together, we’ve determined that ובשלוחו means:
- and/or (ו)
- via/for (ב)
- sent person/thing (שלוח)
- his/its (ו)
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 39|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 39:
Great! Now that we've translated all the words individually, we can try to put them together and translate the clause.
===
> [[#Translate clause]]
===

Translate Clause:
Now that we’ve translated the individual words, let’s translate the first clause as a whole.
===
> [[Translate clause 2|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 2:
So the Mishnah says:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
> _ha’ish mekadesh bo u’b’shlucho_
===
> [[Translate clause 3|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 3:
We saw that:
- האיש _ha’ish_ literally means “the man.”
- מקדש _mekadesh_ literally means “produces/is producing a state of _kiddushin_.”
- בו _bo_ literally means “with/via + himself/itself.”
===
> [[Translate clause 4|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 4:
And we saw that ובשלוחו, _u’b’shlucho_, literally meant:
- and/or (ו)
- via/for (ב)
- his/its sent person/thing (שלוחו)
===
> [[Translate clause 5|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 5:
Now, the ו at the start of ובשלוחו means “or/and,” so it connects בו and בשלוחו, so whichever meaning ב has in בו, it probably means the same thing in ובשלוחו. [[Prefix ב#Meanings|(More)]]
< האיש מקדש *בו ובשלוחו*
===
> [[Translate clause 6|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 6:
So, we had narrowed it down to two possible meanings of ב:
- The man produces kiddushin *for* himself and/or *for* his sent person/thing 🤔
- The man produces kiddushin *via* himself and/or *via* his sent person/thing 🤔
===
> [[Translate clause 7|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 7:
Of these two, because the Mishnah is giving a legal ruling, it makes more sense that it would be telling us _via whom_ the man does something, rather than _for whom_. [[Translate clause 7A|(More)]]
===
> [[Translate clause 8|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 7A:
Additionally, it doesn’t really make sense to say someone is producing kiddushin _for_ “a sent person/thing”:
- Lets say “the man” is making kiddushin _*for*_ “his sent person,”
- Then, if you think about it, the one making kiddushin is the one being sent by the other.
- So, why would the Mishnah be calling the second person a “sent person” when really the first one is the one being sent?
So we see "for" is not a likely translation of ב here.
===
> [[#Translate clause 8|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 8:
So putting that all together, the clause should probably be translated:
> The man produces kiddushin via himself or via his sent person/thing.
===
> [[Translate clause 9|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 9:
If so, then we can also narrow down שלוחו to mean “his sent person,” because it wouldn’t make sense for him to be able to create kiddushin via a sent thing.
===
> [[Translate clause 10|Makes sense]]
===

Translate clause 10:
To simplify things further, we can call a “sent person” a messenger, so the translation would become:
> The man produces kiddushin via himself or via his messenger
===
> [[Translate clause 11|Makes sense]]
===

Translate clause 11:
Now, this might be a good time to learn a rule of the Mishnah which hopefully we will get even clearer later on.
===
> [[Translate clause 12|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 12:
The rule is: a [[“{{present tense}}” verb]] in a Mishnah implies that we are permitted to do the given action “lechatchila” (literally “from the beginning,”) ie as a totally permissible option.
- For example: "the man produced kiddushin via his messenger"
===
> [[Translate clause 13|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 13:
On the other hand, if the Mishnah were to use a past tense verb, that would mean that the given action was “bedieved” (literally, “at [the time of] later”), ie something that only is acceptable if it was already done by accident, or in a situation where there were no other options.
- For example, “the man produced kiddushin via a messenger, and it worked.”
===
> [[Translate clause 14|What?]]
===

Translate clause 14:
So, given that rule, how might we improve our current translation?
> The man produces _kiddushin_ via himself or via his messenger
===
> [[Translate clause 15|Let me think]]
===

Translate clause 15:
If the present tense implies a that an action is totally permissible, then we might change our translation to:
> It is totally permissible for the man to produce _kiddushin_ via himself, or via his messenger.
===
> [[Translate clause 16|Got it]]
===

Translate clause 16:
Great! You can see how we began with a literal translation of the words, ended up with a literal translation of the sentence, and then used rules of the Mishnah to improve our translation further.
===
> [[Translate clause 17|We did that]]
===

Translate clause 17:
Great. Now you can continue on to comprehension questions about the Mishnah’s first clause, or continue to the second clause.

Comprehension Questions:
Now that we’ve read the first clause of the Mishnah, let’s ask some questions.
===
- [[#Lists in the Mishnah|First question]]
- [[{See all} comprehension questions]]
- [[Step two for hashta b’shlucho#Mishnah/Step two for האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה|Next clause]]
===

See all comprehension questions:
This is a list of comprehension questions:
===
1. [[Lists in the Mishnah]]
2. [[“The” man]]
3. [[Why more clauses?]]
4. [[Without this Mishnah?]]
- [[Step two for hashta b’shlucho#Mishnah/Step two for האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה|Next clause]]
===

Lists in the Mishnah:
The first clause of the Mishnah says a man can be _mekadesh_ a woman via himself or via a shaliach.
===
> [[Lists 1|Okay]]
> [[#Lists 11|Just summarize]]
===

Lists 1:
So, we find a list of ways the man can be _mekadesh_, ie himself or with a _shaliach_.
===
> [[Lists 2|Okay]]
===

Lists 2:
So, when someone makes a list of options, what might they mean by it?
===
> [[Lists 3|What?]]
===

Lists 3:
Let’s use an example. If I send you an invitation to “come drive down to my wedding,” what might I mean by that, practically speaking?
===
> [[Lists 4|Let me think]]
===

Lists 4:
Good. So, maybe I mean I am _only_ allowing you to come if you drive.
===
> [[Lists 5|Right]]
===

Lists 5:
So, that is way #1 of understanding when someone gives you an option, that they are implying it is the only acceptable way of doing something.
===
> [[Lists 6|Right]]
===

Lists 6:
Now, what would it mean to interpret a list this way, that it is “telling you the only acceptable way of doing something”?
===
> [[Lists 7|What?]]
===

Lists 7:
We might say such a list is meant as “exhaustive” – the things on the list would be your only options, and all options would be on the list.
===
> [[Lists 8|Makes sense]]
===

Lists 8:
Ok, so, when I said “come drive to my wedding,” what *else* might I have meant besides that you _have_ to drive?
===
> [[Lists 9|Let me think]]
===

Lists 9:
Well, maybe I just meant you _can_ drive, as an example.
===
> [[Lists 10|Right]]
===

Lists 10:
So, way #2 of understanding when someone gives you a list of options is that they are just examples, but there may be others.
===
> [[Lists 11|Right]]
===

Lists 11:
*So:* the question is, how should we understand a list of options in the Mishnah?
- Is it as an _exhaustive_ list, and there are no other options?
- Is it as an _illustrative_ list, and there may be other options also?
- Are there other possibilities besides just those two?
===
> [[Lists 12|Good question]]
===

Lists 12:
Indeed! Hold that thought, and we'll check back in later to see what the Gemara seems to think about it.
===
> [[Lists 13|I can't wait that long!]]
===

Lists 13:
Sometimes in life we have to be patient! 🐢⏳
===
> [[Lists 14|Fine]]
===

Lists 14:
Great! Now you can continue to the next question, review all questions, or go on to the next clause of the Mishnah.
===
> [[#"The" man|Next question]]
> [[#See all comprehension questions|All questions]]
> [[Step two for hashta b’shlucho#Mishnah/Step two for האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה|Next clause]]
===

“The” man:
The Mishnah begins with the word _ha’ish_, האיש, which we translated as “the man.”
===
> [[“The” man 2|Okay]]
===

“The” man 2:
But, we saw that in context, the Mishnah is teaching a rule that applies to all men.
===
> [[“The” man 3|Okay]]
===

“The” man 3:
So why doesn’t the Mishnah say _ish mekadesh bo u’bshlucho_ “איש מקדש בו ובשלוחו,” _a_ man may _mekadesh_ himself or with a _shaliach_?
- (Tangent: You can learn more about [[the word “a” ie the {{indefinite article}}]].)
===
> [[“The” man 4|Okay]]
===

“The” man 4:
Or, it could say _anashim mekadshim_, (אנשים מקשים) _men_ may be _mekadesh_ in these two ways.
===
> [[“The” man 5|Okay]]
===

“The” man 5:
Or, it could have just said _mekadshim banu u'b'shlucheinu_, (מקדשים בנו ובשלוחינו) “we” are _mekadesh_, either via ourselves and via our _shluchim_.
===
> [[“The” man 6|Okay]]
===

“The” man 6:
So, in summary, we have a difficulty, why did the Mishnah say "the man" when it seems as if there would have been more fitting ways to express the idea?
===
> [[“The” man 7|Okay]]
===

“The” man 7:
We could say that this is just the style of the Mishnah.
===
> [[“The” man 8|Okay]]
===

“The” man 8:
We could also say that maybe it means “the” man as in “the man in the situation, as opposed to the woman in the situation.”
===
> [[“The” man 9|Okay]]
===

“The” man 9:
One final possibility is that our Mishnah is coming a bit after another Mishnah that began by speaking about “the” woman, _ha’isha niknas b’shalosh derachim_, “the woman is acquired for marriage via three methods.” So, the use of the word “the” in our Mishnah could be due to a continuation of this first sentence: “The woman is acquired via such and such ... [as opposed to] the man [who] acquires via such and such” etc.
===
> [[“The” man 10|Okay]]
===

“The” man 10:
So, it doesn't end up making a big difference, but it is something interesting to notice.
===
> [[#Why more clauses?|Next question]]
> [[#See all comprehension questions|All questions]]
> [[Step two for hashta b’shlucho#Mishnah/Step two for האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה|Next clause]]
===

Why more clauses?
Okay, so now we understand the first clause of the Mishnah very well.
===
> [[Why more 2|Yes]]
===

Why more 2:
Great. So, what did we learn from the first clause of the Mishnah?
===
> [[Why more 3|What?]]
===

Why more 3:
The Mishnah told us that a man can be mekadesh a woman either via himself or via a shaliach.
===
> [[Why more 4|Yes]]
===

Why more 4:
Theoretically, maybe we can infer from that that it is okay to use a shaliach to do things in general.
===
> [[Why more 5|Okay]]
===

Why more 5:
So here’s a question: why isn’t this the end of the Mishnah?
===
> [[Why more 6|What?]]
===

Why more 6:
If we’ve learned that a man can use a shaliach for kiddushin, and possibly also that using a shliach in general is okay, what more can the Mishnah teach me about this topic that I don't already know?
===
> [[Why more 7|Interesting]]
===

Why more 7:
Yes, very interesting. So think about that, and when we see what the Mishnah goes on to say, you can check if you predicted what more needed to be said.
===
> [[Why more 8|Okay]]
===

Why more 8:
Great! That’s all for now.
===
> [[#Without this Mishnah?|Next question]]
> [[#See all comprehension questions|All questions]]
> [[Step two for hashta b’shlucho#Mishnah/Step two for האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה|Next clause]]
===

Without this Mishnah?
So, we just saw the Mishnah tell us “a man is entirely permitted to produce kiddushin via himself or via his messenger.”
===
> [[Without Mishnah 2|We did]]
===

Without Mishnah 2:
So, there is a principle that we find the Gemara assumes in many places, which is that every statement of the Mishnah is a “chiddush” or innovation.
===
> [[Without Mishnah 3|Okay]]
===

Without Mishnah 3:
This means that every statement of the Mishnah should be telling me something that I wouldn’t have known otherwise.
===
> [[Without Mishnah 4|Okay]]
===

Without Mishnah 4:
Put another way: the existence of this Mishnah implies there is something counterintuitive or nonobvious about the fact that a man can make kiddushin via himself or a via a messenger.
===
> [[Without Mishnah 5|Okay]]
===

Without Mishnah 5:
It doesn't seem possible that I would have thought a man can't produce kiddushin with a woman via himself, because there is an explicit verse in the Torah that says he can [(Devarim 24:1)](https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.24.1?ven=The_Rashi_chumash_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein&lang=he&aliyot=1).
===
> [[Without Mishnah 6|Okay]]
===

Without Mishnah 6:
So, it would seem the existence of this Mishnah is implying that without it I would think that it would not be entirely permissible for a man to create kiddushin via a messenger.
===
> [[Without Mishnah 7|Okay]]
===

Without Mishnah 7:
Now, let’s think about this. How do things work in this presumed world without our Mishnah?
===
> [[Without Mishnah 8|Okay]]
===

Without Mishnah 8:
Without our Mishnah, would I assume that a man is not permitted to use a messenger to produce kiddushin?
===
> [[Without Mishnah 9|Maybe]]
===

Without Mishnah 9:
Or, would I assume that it doesn't work or accomplish anything to use a messenger to produce kiddushin?
===
> [[Without Mishnah 10|Interesting]]
===

Without Mishnah 10:
Are there other possibilities than those?
===
> [[Without Mishnah 11|Let me think]]
===

Without Mishnah 11:
So, we may never actually get an answer to this question, but it is a useful type of question to be asking when you learn a Mishnah.
===
> [[Without Mishnah 12|Great.]]
===

Without Mishnah 12:
Wonderful. Now you can return to the list of questions, or move on to the next clause of the Mishnah.
===
> [[#See all comprehension questions|All questions]]
> [[Step two for hashta b’shlucho#Mishnah/Step two for האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה|Next clause]]
===

How can we understand the specificity of the Mishnah?
When the Mishnah gives a list of things, is that generally davka, lav davka, or the biggest chiddush and kol shekain all less-surprising examples?

What would I have thought in the absence of this Mishnah?

- Introduce the idea of there being three types of specificity, but leave it ambiguous until the Gemara which kind the Gemara thinks the Mishnah is.

What if it hadn't said בו?

What would I have thought if it didn’t say ובשלוחו?

Whose opinion are we trying to figure out?
Is there someone whose mind we could read to see if R Yosef is correct about what he is saying? (Getting the student to recognize that this is a machlochus over the intent of the tana, not stam over what the halacha is.)
