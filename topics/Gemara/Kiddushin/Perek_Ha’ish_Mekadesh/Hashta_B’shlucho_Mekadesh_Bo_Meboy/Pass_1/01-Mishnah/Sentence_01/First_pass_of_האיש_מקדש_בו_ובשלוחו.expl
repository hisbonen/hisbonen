First pass of האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו:
Let's learn the first clause of the Mishnah:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[First Pass 2|Let's go]]
> [[First pass of האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה|Next clause]]
===

First Pass 2:
Let's clarify background concepts, and then translate the clause and ask comprehension questions.
===
- [[Background]]
- [[Identify Break]]
- [[Translate Words]]
- [[Translate Clause]]
- [[Comprehension Questions]]
===

Background:
There are various concepts you should be familiar with before trying to read the first clause:
===
- [[Kiddushin]]
- [[Nisuyin]]
- [[Shlichus]]
- [[#Identify Break|Next]]
===

Kiddushin:
Let's learn about Kiddushin.
===
> [[Kiddushin 2|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 2:
When a man wants to marry a woman, there is a first step called “Kiddushin.”
===
> [[Kiddushin 3|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 3:
Kiddushin comes from the root קדש which is related to holiness and items designated for sacred purposes.
===
> [[Kiddushin 4|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 4:
Kiddushin is often translated as “engagement,” but there are a few important differences between kiddushin and regular engagement.
===
> [[Kiddushin 5|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 5:
Via Kiddushin, a man acquires the exclusive rights to later marry a given woman.
===
> [[Kiddushin 6|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 6:
Unlike a casual engagement where either party can reneg, Kiddushin gives a woman the status of an _aishes ish_ after which her husband would have to give her a _get_ for her to marry someone else.
===
> [[Kiddushin 7|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 7:
After Kiddushin, the couple is not married and may not cohabit without first achieving a second status called _nisuyin_.
===
> [[Kiddushin 8|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 8:
The first perek of Tractate Kiddushin discusses the ways a man can engage a woman. They include giving an object of value, using a contract, or indicating to witnesses that physical relations are intended to accomplish this goal.
===
> [[Kiddushin 9|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 9:
We say a man who establishes kiddushin with a woman is being _mekadesh_ her.
===
> [[Kiddushin 10|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 10:
A woman who enters into a state of kiddushin is called _mekudeshes_.
===
> [[Kiddushin 11|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 11:
Great! Now we can learn more about the second stage of marriage _nisuyin_, or continue to reading the Mishnah.
===
> [[#Nisuyin]]
> [[#Translate Words]]
===

Nisuyin:
After producing the status of kiddushin, a man and women must enter a second status called _nisuyin_ to complete the marriage process.
===
> [[Nisuyin 2|Okay]]
===

Nisuyin 2:
The word _nisuyin_ comes from the shoresh נשׂא which can also mean to carry or lift something.
===
> [[Nisuyin 3|Okay]]
===

Nisuyin 3:
The process of nisuyin involves a groom taking the bride into a structure designated as his house in order to establish the start of the marriage.
===
> [[Nisuyin 4|Okay]]
===

Nisuyin 4:
Different parts of the marriage ceremony accomplish nisuyin according to different opinions.
- Some hold that nisuyin is accomplished by the "bedekin" when the groom identifies his wife at the ceremony
- Some hold the “yichud room” accompishes nisuyin
- Some hold that the bride entering the chupa accomplishes nisuyin
- Some hold only the groom actually taking his bride to his real home after the wedding accomplishes nisuyin.
===
> [[Nisuyin 5|Okay]]
===

Nisuyin 5:
After _nisuyin_, the marriage can only be dissolved via a bill of divorce or death of the husband, but the same thing is true from the beginning of the earlier _kiddushin_ stage.
===
> [[Nisuyin 6|Okay]]
===

Nisuyin 6:
Great! Now we can learn a bit about the concept of “slichus,” or continue to translate the Mishnah.
===
> [[#Shlichus]]
> [[#Translate Words]]
===

Shlichus:
We will learn more about the concept of shlichus from the Mishnah, but now we will just get clear the basic vocabulary so we're all on the same page.
===
> [[Shlichus 2|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 2:
The word shlichus comes from the root שלח which is related to the concept of sending.
===
> [[Shlichus 3|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 3:
“Shlichus” is an abstract term that refers to the concept of designating someone to do something on one’s behalf.
===
> [[Shlichus 4|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 4:
Someone who is designated to do something for someone else is called a “shaliach.”
===
> [[Shlichus 5|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 5:
A person who sends an appointed person to accomplish a task can be called a “sholeach” or a “mishaleach.”
===
> [[Shlichus 6|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 6:
We will see when and under what circumstances a person may use a shaliach.
===
> [[Shlichus 7|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 7:
Great! Now lets continue to word translation, or skip to translating the first clause as a whole.
===
> [[#Translate words]]
> [[#Translate clause]]
===

Identify Break:
How do we know where the first clause of the Mishnah ends?
===
> [[Identify Break 2|How?]]
===

Identify Break 2:
Even if we don't know the meaning of the words, we should be able to notice some similar-looking patterns being repeated:
< *האיש מקדש* בו ובשלוחו *האשה מתקדשת* בה ובשלוחה *האיש מקדש* את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[Identify Break 3|I see a pattern!]]
===

Identify Break 3:
Great! Based on this pattern, we should be able to recognize that the Mishnah is composed of three similar parts, and we can begin by focusing on the first one:
< *האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו* האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[#Translate Words]]
===

Translate Words:
Let's translate the individual words, then [[#Translate Clause|the clause as a whole]]
<==
- [[1. {{האיש}}]]
- [[2. {{מקדש}}]]
- [[3. {{בו}}]]
- [[4. {{ובשלוחו}}]]
===

האיש:
To understand the word “האיש”:
===
- [[{General translation} of האיש]]
- [[{Contextual translation} of האיש]]
- [[{Grammatical explanation} of האיש]]
===

General translation of האיש: In general the word “האיש” means “the man.”

Contextual translation of האיש: In this context, it means “a man” because we’re not speaking about any one man in particular. Sometimes the Mishnah will use the word “the” slightly differently than we would in English.

Grammatical explanation of האיש:
We can giev a grammatical explanation of האיש:
- האיש is the [[{{Hebrew definite article}} “ה”]] before the noun “איש”.

How you could figure the meaning of האיש out yourself:
Here’s how you could figure out the meaning of האיש yourself:
- First, let's remember that we're reading a Mishnah and so the language is going to be Hebrew and not Aramaic.
- Next, we should see if any of the letters are potentially prefixes or suffixes rather than being part of the underlying word.
- ה is sometimes a prefix, but ש is never a suffix, so we can conclude that either “האיש” is one big word, or the ה is a prefix, and the real word is איש.
- (It could also be that ה is a prefix and א is another prefix after that, but א is only a prefix in the Hebrew future tense first person (e.g. “I will run”), and there’s no situation in Hebrew where you can have a ה prefix followed by a future tense verb.)
- Thus, we can look up the word “האיש” in the dictionary, see that it doesn’t exist, and then try “איש,” and we would see that it does exist and is a noun meaning “man.”
- Once we know איש is a noun, the ה prefix can't be any of the [[verb forms beginning with ה|verb-related ה prefixes]], and so by process of elimination we know it is the [[Hebrew definite article]].

מקדש:
To understand the word “מקדש”:
===
- [[{General translation} of מקדש]]
- [[{Contextual translation} of מקדש]]
- [[{Grammatical explanation} of מקדש]]
===

General translation of מקדש:
To translate the word מקדש in general, first we should note that it is an ongoing “ing” verb like “running,” and it refers to someone who is making holiness in some way. For example:
- Hashem is _mekadesh es hashabos_, which means Hashem makes the Sabbath holy by designating it as special.
- When we say _kiddush_ before a holiday meal, this is referred to as “being _mekadesh_.”
- When a man wants to marry a woman, he must first create the “binding engagement” stage called _kiddushin_, and doing so is refered to as the man “being _mekadesh_” a woman.
The word מקדש is also in the “masculine singular,” so we are speaking about one man doing the action. So, מקדש means some man or masculine entity is doing one of the previously mentioned actions in an ongoing way.

Contextual translation of מקדש:
We can give a contextual translation of the word מקדש.
- In this context, we are in _Meseches Kiddushin_ so we know we are probably speaking about marriage, and so even though “מקדש” can have several meanings, here we are probably referring to a man who is creating the binding engagement stage of marriage called _kiddushin_ with one woman.
- However, the ongoing nature of the verb makes it sound like we are telling a story about a particular man doing this, but that seems a bit out of place here, and so we’ll have to remember that in the Mishnah, the ongoing “present tense” is used to communicate halachic rulings, and so if it says “we are making _kiddush_” that might mean “individuals are obligated to make kiddush” and if it says “a man is buying an item with a contract,” that would mean “a man is _able_ to buy an item using a contract.”
- Thus, the word מקדש here means “[a man is] able to create the _kiddushin_ stage of marriage [...],” and we are anticipating further details about how this is done.

Grammatical explanation of מקדש:
We can give a grammatical explanation of the word מקדש:
- מקדש comes from the [[shoresh]] קדש
- מקדש is from the [[{{pi’el}} binyan]]. ([[{{Binyan}} is a grammatical concept in Hebrew and Aramaic]].)
- The meaning of מקדש is determined by the meanings of [the shoresh קדש in the pi’el].
- מקדש is a [[pi'el active participle]], an example of an [[active participle]] which is one of [[the two types of {{participle}}]], which are two of the [[“tenses” of Hebrew and Aramaic]].
- מקדש is in the masculine singular, so we are speaking about one man or one masculine entity.

How you could figure the meaning of מקדש out yourself:
Here's how you could figure out the meaning of מקדש yourself:
- First, let's remember that we're reading a Mishnah, and so the language is going to be Hebrew.
- We might know that there is a noun spelled מקדש, מִקְדָּשׁ meaning temple or sanctuary, but because we just saw האיש which is a noun, now we are probably looking for a verb.
- So, every verb should have 2-3 visible letters of the [[shoresh]], so we'll want to identify what shoresh this is.
- We have 4 [[strong letters]], so only three of those can be part of the verb, so either the מ is a prefix, or the ש is a suffix.
- There are [[several {{Hebrew verb forms beginning with מ}}]], but ש is never a suffix, so we've narrowed it down to those verb forms.
- The only one of those forms that has only a מ prefix and not an extra ת or י or ו is the [[{{pi'el active participle}} for regular shorushim]].
- Once we know the binyan and tense, we can see that the lack of a suffix indicates this is a masculine singular.

Translate Clause:
Now that we've translated the individual words, lets translate the first clause as a whole.

Comprehension Questions:
Now that we've read the first clause of the Mishnah, let's ask some questions.
===
- [#Lists in the Mishnah|Get started]
- [[{See all} comprehension questions]]

See all comprehension questions:
===
1. [[Lists in the Mishnah]]
===

Lists in the Mishnah:
The first clause of the Mishnah says a man can be _mekadesh_ a woman via himself or via a shaliach.
===
> [[Comprehension 1|Okay]]
> [[Just Summarize]]
===

Just Summarize:
When we see a list of options in the Mishnah, does it mean that those options are the only options, is it an illustrative list, or might there even be some third way of interpreting the list? Stay tuned.
===
> [[See all comprehension questions|Back to questions]]
===

Comprehension 1:
So, we find a list of ways the man can be _mekadesh_, ie himself or with a _shaliach_.
===
> [[Comprehension 2|Okay]]
===

Comprehension 2:
So, when someone makes a list of options, what might they mean by it?
===
> [[Comprehension 3|What?]]
===

Comprehension 3:
Let’s use a simpler example. If I send you an invitation to “come drive down to my wedding” – what might I mean by that, practically speaking?
===
> [[Comprehension 4|Let me think]]
===

Comprehension 4:
Take your time.
===
> [[Comprehension 5|I give up]]
===

Comprehension 5:
Maybe I mean I am _only_ allowing you to come if you drive.
===
> [[Comprehension 6|Right]]
===

Comprehension 6:
So, that’s option #1 how to understand a specificity, that I meant it “b’davka”, as the only that way that is acceptable.
===
> [[Comprehension 7|Right]]
===

Comprehension 7:
Now, what would it mean to interpret a list in the Mishnah this way, as being meant “b’davka?”
===
> [[Comprehension 8|What?]]
===

Comprehension 8:
We might say such a list would be meant as “exhaustive” – the things on the list would be your only options, and all options would be on the list.
===
> [[Comprehension 9|Makes sense]]
===

Comprehension 9:
Ok, so, when I said “come drive to my wedding,” what *else* might I have meant besides that you _have_ to drive?
===
> [[Comprehension 10|Let me think]]
===

Comprehension 10:
Take your time.
===
> [[Comprehension 11|I give up]]
===

Comprehension 11:
Well, maybe I just meant you _can_ drive, as an example.
===
> [[Comprehension 12|Right]]
===

Comprehension 12:
So now, ask yourself, how should we understand a list in the Mishnah?
- Should we understand it as an _exhaustive_ list, and there are no other options?
- Or, should we understand it as an _illustrative_ list, and there may be other options also?
===
> [[Comprehension 13|Good question]]
===

Comprehension 13:
Indeed! Hold that thought, and we'll check back in later to see what the Gemara seems to think about it.
===
> [[Comprehension 14|I can't wait that long!]]
===

Comprehension 14:
Sometimes in life we have to be patient! 🐢⏳
===
> [[#See all comprehension questions|Back to questions]]

===
- [[How can we understand the specificity of the Mishnah?]]
- [[What would I have thought in the absence of this Mishnah?]]
- [[What if it hadn't said בו?]]
- [[What would I have thought if it didn’t say ובשלוחו?]]
- [[Whose opinion are we trying to figure out?]]
===

How can we understand the specificity of the Mishnah?
When the Mishnah gives a list of things, is that generally davka, lav davka, or the biggest chiddush and kol shekain all less-surprising examples?

What would I have thought in the absence of this Mishnah?

- Introduce the idea of there being three types of specificity, but leave it ambiguous until the Gemara which kind the Gemara thinks the Mishnah is.

What if it hadn't said בו?

What would I have thought if it didn’t say ובשלוחו?

Whose opinion are we trying to figure out?
Is there someone whose mind we could read to see if R Yosef is correct about what he is saying? (Getting the student to recognize that this is a machlochus over the intent of the tana, not stam over what the halacha is.)
