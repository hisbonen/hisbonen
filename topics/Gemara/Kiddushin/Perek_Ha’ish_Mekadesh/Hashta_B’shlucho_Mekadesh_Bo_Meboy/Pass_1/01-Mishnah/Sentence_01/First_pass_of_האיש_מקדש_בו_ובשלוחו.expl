First pass of האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו:
Let's learn the first clause of the Mishnah:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[First Pass 2|Let's go]]
> [[Step 2 of hashta b’shlucho#Mishnah/First pass of האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה|Next clause]]
===

First Pass 2:
Let's clarify key terms, and then translate the clause and ask comprehension questions.
===
- [[Key terms]]
- [[Translation]]
- [[Comprehension <br>Questions]]
===

Key terms:
There are various concepts you should be familiar with before trying to read the first clause:
===
- [[Kiddushin]]
- [[Nisuyin]]
- [[Shlichus]]
- [[#Identify clause break|Translate]]
===

Kiddushin:
Let's learn about Kiddushin.
===
> [[Kiddushin 2|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 2:
When a man wants to marry a woman, there is a first step called “Kiddushin.”
===
> [[Kiddushin 3|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 3:
Kiddushin comes from the root קדש which is related to holiness and items designated for sacred purposes.
===
> [[Kiddushin 4|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 4:
Kiddushin is often translated as “engagement,” but there are a few important differences between kiddushin and regular engagement.
===
> [[Kiddushin 5|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 5:
Via Kiddushin, a man acquires the exclusive rights to later marry a given woman.
===
> [[Kiddushin 6|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 6:
Unlike a casual engagement where either party can reneg, Kiddushin gives a woman the status of an _aishes ish_ after which her husband would have to give her a _get_ for her to marry someone else.
===
> [[Kiddushin 7|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 7:
After Kiddushin, the couple is not married and may not cohabit without first achieving a second status called _nisuyin_.
===
> [[Kiddushin 8|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 8:
The first perek of Tractate Kiddushin discusses the ways a man can engage a woman. They include giving an object of value, using a contract, or indicating to witnesses that physical relations are intended to accomplish this goal.
===
> [[Kiddushin 9|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 9:
We say a man who establishes kiddushin with a woman is being _mekadesh_ her.
===
> [[Kiddushin 10|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 10:
A woman who enters into a state of kiddushin is called _mekudeshes_.
===
> [[Kiddushin 11|Okay]]
===

Kiddushin 11:
Great! Now we can learn more about the second stage of marriage _nisuyin_, or continue to reading the Mishnah.
===
> [[#Nisuyin]]
> [[#Translate Words]]
===

Nisuyin:
After producing the status of kiddushin, a man and women must enter a second status called _nisuyin_ to complete the marriage process.
===
> [[Nisuyin 2|Okay]]
===

Nisuyin 2:
The word _nisuyin_ comes from the shoresh נשׂא which can also mean to carry or lift something.
===
> [[Nisuyin 3|Okay]]
===

Nisuyin 3:
The process of nisuyin involves a groom taking the bride into a structure designated as his house in order to establish the start of the marriage.
===
> [[Nisuyin 4|Okay]]
===

Nisuyin 4:
Different parts of the marriage ceremony accomplish nisuyin according to different opinions.
- Some hold that nisuyin is accomplished by the "bedekin" when the groom identifies his wife at the ceremony
- Some hold the “yichud room” accompishes nisuyin
- Some hold that the bride entering the chupa accomplishes nisuyin
- Some hold only the groom actually taking his bride to his real home after the wedding accomplishes nisuyin.
===
> [[Nisuyin 5|Okay]]
===

Nisuyin 5:
After _nisuyin_, the marriage can only be dissolved via a bill of divorce or death of the husband, but the same thing is true from the beginning of the earlier _kiddushin_ stage.
===
> [[Nisuyin 6|Okay]]
===

Nisuyin 6:
Great! Now we can learn a bit about the concept of “slichus,” or continue to translate the Mishnah.
===
> [[#Shlichus]]
> [[#Translate Words]]
===

Shlichus:
We will learn more about the concept of shlichus from the Mishnah, but now we will just get clear the basic vocabulary so we're all on the same page.
===
> [[Shlichus 2|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 2:
The word shlichus comes from the root שלח which is related to the concept of sending.
===
> [[Shlichus 3|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 3:
“Shlichus” is an abstract term that refers to the concept of designating someone to do something on one’s behalf.
===
> [[Shlichus 4|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 4:
Someone who is designated to do something for someone else is called a “shaliach” (שליח) The plural is “shluchim” (שלוחים.)
===
> [[Shlichus 5|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 5:
The one sending the shliach can be called a “sholeach” (שולח) or a “mishaleach” (משלח.)
===
> [[Shlichus 6|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 6:
We will see when and under what circumstances a person may use a shaliach.
===
> [[Shlichus 7|Okay]]
===

Shlichus 7:
Great! Now lets continue to word translation, or skip to translating the words of the clause.
===
> [[#Identify Clause break]]
> [[#Translate words]]
===

Translation:
Let's identify the first clause, translate the words, then translate the sentence.
===
- [[Identify clause break]]
- [[Translate words]]
- [[Translate clause]]
===

Identify clause break:
How do we know where the first clause of the Mishnah ends?
===
> [[Identify Break 2|How?]]
===

Identify Break 2:
Even if we don't know the meaning of the words, we should be able to notice some similar-looking patterns being repeated:
< *האיש מקדש* בו ובשלוחו *האשה
< מתקדשת* בה ובשלוחה *האיש
< מקדש* את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[Identify Break 3|I see a pattern!]]
===

Identify Break 3:
Great! Based on this pattern, we should be able to recognize that the Mishnah is composed of three similar parts, and we can begin by focusing on the first one:
< *האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו* האשה מתקדשת בה ובשלוחה האיש מקדש את בתו כשהיא נערה בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[#Translate Words]]
===

Translate Words:
Let's translate the individual words, then [[#Translate clause|translate the clause as a whole]]
<==
- [[1. {{האיש}}]]
- [[2. {{מקדש}}]]
- [[3. {{בו}}]]
- [[4. {{ובשלוחו}}]]
===

האיש:
Let's translate the word “האיש”:
===
> [[Ha'ish 2|Okay]]
===

Ha'ish 2:
How might we figure out the meaning of the word “האיש”?
===
> [[Ha'ish 3|How]]
> [[#Ha'ish 5|Just tell me]]
===

Ha'ish 3:
We see that the first letter is ה, which tips us off to the fact that “האיש” is either:
1. A noun starting with “the” which is ה in Hebrew ([[Hebrew definite article|learn more]])
2. A type of past-tense verb that begins with ה ([[Verb forms beginning with ה|learn more]])
3. A proper noun and ה is part of the actual name or shoresh ([[learn more about {{shoresh}}]]).
===
> [[Ha'ish 4|Ok]]
===

Ha'ish 4:
If we know that איש means man, then we can narrow it down to probably being the first option, ה meaning “the.”
- We can tell it isn't a verb if we recognize that there isn't a [[shoresh]] that would produce that letter combination. ([[Ha'ish 4-1|More]])
===
> [[Ha'ish 5|Ok]]
===

Ha'ish 4-1:
Just for purely theoretical interest, if there would be a [[shoresh]] with a weak first letter like נאש, then putting that shoresh into the [[hifil past tense]] could indeed produce a past tense “האיש” but, there is no such shoresh.
===
> [[#Ha'ish 5|Ok]]
===

Ha'ish 5:
So literally “האיש” _ha’ish_ means “the man.”
===
> [[Ha'ish 6|Ok]]
===

Ha'ish 6:
Now, the phrase “the man [such and such]” sounds more like we’re telling a story than giving a legal ruling, so we can see from context that it probably means “all men [have the following something].”
===
> [[Ha'ish 7|Ok]]
===

Ha'ish 7:
Great, that's all for now. You can read more about the word איש or the Hebrew prefix ה, or move on to the next word, or skip to the sentence-translation.

===

מקדש:
Let's translate the word מקדש.
===
> [[Mekadesh 2|Great!]]
===

Mekadesh 2:
How could you figure out yourself what it means?
===
> [[Mekadesh 3|How?]]
> [[#Mekadesh 17|Just tell me]]
===

Mekadesh 3:
First we might notice that the word begins with מ. Given that the Mishnah is in Hebrew, that should tip us off that it could be:
1. A Hebrew verb form that begins with a מ prefix ([[Hebrew verb forms beginning with מ|More]])
2. Some Hebrew noun formed by adding מ prefix to a shoresh ([[Noun patterns that begin with מ|More]])
3. A proper noun that just happens to start with מ
4. A word formed from a [[shoresh]] that happens to begin with מ
===
> [[Mekadesh 4|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 4:
Now, we also have to be careful, because there may be multiple words that are spelled מקדש.
===
> [[Mekadesh 5|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 5:
If we assume the מ of מקדש is some kind of prefix, we are left with קדש which are three strong letters ([[Strong letters|learn more]]) suggesting that the [[shoresh]] of the word could be קדש.
===
> [[Mekadesh 6|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 6:
If we look up the shoresh קדש in the dictionary we will find that it is indeed a real shoresh, related to the idea of "holiness."
- [See in Klein](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%81.1)
- [See in Jastrow](https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%A7%D6%B8%D7%93%D6%B7%D7%A9%D7%81.1)
===
> [[Mekadesh 7|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 7:
Now, even if we recognize the shoresh is קדש, we're still not sure if this is a noun or a verb.
===
> [[Mekadesh 8|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 8:
If it is a verb, we can look at the five Hebrew verb forms that start with מ, and see if any of them fit this spelling:
- מְקַדֵּשׁ, _mekadeish,_ “he makes holy/creates _kiddushin_” [[pi’el active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מְקוּדָּשׁ, _mekudash_ “he/it is made holy, receives _kiddushin_ status” [[pu’al active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מַקְדִּישׁ, _makdish_ “he sets aside for a holy purpose” [[hif’il active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מוּקְדָּשׁ, _mukdash,_ “it is set aside for holy purpose” [[huf’al active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
- מִתְקַדֵּשׁ, _miskadeish_ “he makes himself holy” [[hispa’el active participle for regular shorushim|(More)]]
===
> [[Mekadesh 9|I see a match]]
===

Mekadesh 9:
Great, we should notice that only one verb form produces a word spelled מקדש, namely מְקַדֵּשׁ, meaning either "he creates holiness" or as a technical term "he creates the _kiddushin_ stage prior to marriage"
- So, if מקדש is a verb, it is probably מְקַדֵּשׁ.
===
> [[Mekadesh 10|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 10:
Now, are we sure that מקדש is actually a verb? We can check the dictionary and see if there are any nouns spelled that way.
===
> [[Mekadesh 11|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 11:
We can do it together:
- [מקדש in Klein dictionary](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%3C_%D8%10E%D7%B5%D8%A8%D7%B1%D8%94%D7%B6%D7%BC%D8%A10%D8%82.2)
- [מקדש in Jastrow dictionary](https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%3C_%D8%10E%D7%B5%D8%A8%D7%B1%D8%94%D7%B9%D7%BC%D8%A10%D8%82.2)
===
> [[Mekadesh 12|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 12:
Great, so we actually find that there is also a noun spelled מקדש,‎ “מִקְדָּשׁ” meaning “sanctuary.” We also don't find any proper nouns or names spelled מקדש.
===
> [[Mekadesh 13|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 13:
So, we found a verb form that would fit, מְקַדֵּשׁ _mekadesh_, “he makes holiness/creates _kiddushin_” and a noun that it might be, מִקְדָּשׁ _mikdash_, “sanctuary.”
===
> [[Mekadesh 14|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 14:
Now, let's remember that we are in Maseches Kiddushin, which speaks about how a man produces the _kiddushin_ stage prior to marriage.
===
> [[Mekadesh 15|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 15:
So, it would seem that the verb we identified מְקַדֵּשׁ, which can mean “he creates the _kiddushin_ stage prior to marriage” is the most likely meaning.
===
> [[Mekadesh 16|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 16:
Additionally, we already saw a noun in the sentence, “האיש”, so it makes sense that what would come next is a verb. [[Mekadesh 16-3|(More)]]
===
> [[Mekadesh 17|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 16-3:
We just said because האיש is a noun then we should be expecting a verb, but it isn't actually so simple.
- You could have two nouns back-to-back in a form called the [[construct state]]
- You also have [[more flexible {{word-order in Hebrew and Aramaic}}]] so even in a simple sentence there's no guarantee the verb would be next.
===
> [[#Mekadesh 17|Okay]]
===

Mekadesh 17:
*Great:* So we've settled on the word מקדש being the Hebrew verb מְקַדֵּשׁ, in its meaning of “he produces/is producing kiddushin,” and for those interested, identified that form as the [[{{active participle}} form]] of the [[{{pi’el}} binyan]].
===
> [[Mekadesh 18|Great]]
===

Mekadesh 18:
Sounds good. Now you can read more about the shoresh קדש, move on to the next word in the clause בו, or skip to translating the sentence as a whole.

> [[#בו|Next:<br>Translate בו]]
> [[#Translate Clause|Continue:<br>Translate Clause]]
===

בו:
Let's translate the word בו.
===
> [[Bo 2|Great!]]
===

Bo 2:
How could you figure out what בו means yourself?
===
> [[Bo 3|How]]
> [[#Bo 13|Just tell me]]
===

Bo 3:
So, you might know that there is a word “bo” that means he comes or he came, but that word is always spelled with an א as in בוא
===
> [[Bo 4|Okay]]
===

Bo 4:
So, you might also know that that there is a prefix ב that comes before nouns and can mean in/with/for/on/at and a few other options.
- You can see the full list [[The prefix ב#Meanings|here]]
===
> [[Bo 5|Okay]]
===

Bo 5:
For example, _babayis_, בבית, means “in the house.”
===
> [[Bo 6|Okay]]
===

Bo 6:
Now, it is common for prefixes to also exist in a standalone form using certain standard suffixes for person.
===
> [[Bo 7|Okay]]
===

Bo 7:
So, for example, the prefix ל usually means “to,” the suffix י usually means “me,” and so לי will mean “to me.”
===
> [[Bo 8|Okay]]
===

Bo 8:
So, a ו after a prefix usually means “him/it.” לו would mean “to him/it.”
===
> [[Bo 9|Okay]]
===

Bo 9:
So, over here can you guess what בו means?
===
> [[Bo 10|I can try]]
===

Bo 10:
Great! So, however you translate the ב prefix in this context, ie with/in/at/for etc, adding ו to get בו would mean with/in/at/for _*him/it*_.
===
> [[Bo 11|Okay]]
===

Bo 11:
Great, so now at least we know what word it is, the prefix ב with a third-person masculine ו suffix, we just don't know which meaning of ב it is, ie with/in/at/for etc.
===
> [[Bo 12|Okay]]
===

Bo 12:
So, how can we figure out what ב means here? We can go through the list and try which ones fit.
- The man makes kiddushin *in* himself ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *at* himself ❌
- The man makes kiddushin *with* himself 🤔
- The man makes kiddushin *for* himself 🤔
===
> [[Bo 13|Okay]]
===

Bo 13:
*Okay so:* we might not actually have enough information at this point to figure out the exact meaning, so for now, we’ll translate בו as “with/for himself.”
===
> [[Bo 14|Okay]]
===

Bo 14:
Great! You can read more about the prefix ב, or continue to the translation of the next word.
===
> [[The prefix ב]]
> [Prefix ב in Klein](https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%91%D6%B0%D6%BC%E2%97%8C.1)
> [[#ובשלוחו|Next:<br>Translate ובשלוחו]]
===

ובשלוחו:
Let's translate ובשלוחו.
===
> [U’b’shlucho|Okay]
===

U’b’shlucho 2:
*Okay so:* we might not actually have enough information at this point to figure out the exact meaning, so for now, we’ll translate בו as “with/for himself.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 3|Okay]]
===

U’b’shlucho 2:
*Okay so:* we might not actually have enough information at this point to figure out the exact meaning, so for now, we’ll translate בו as “with/for himself.”
===
> [[U’b’shlucho 3|Okay]]
===

Translate Clause:
Now that we've translated the individual words, lets translate the first clause as a whole.
===
> [[Translate clause 2|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 2:
So the Mishnah says:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
> _ha’ish mekadesh bo u’b’shlucho_
===
> [[Translate clause 3|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 3:
We saw that _ha’ish_ האיש literally means “the man.” It seems clear from context that it means any man, so we’ll translate it as “a man” and think about the difference later.
===
> [[Translate clause 4|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 4:
We saw that _mekadesh_ מקדש literally means “produces/is producing a state of _kiddushin_” ([[#Kiddushin|Feel free to refresh your memory on what _kiddushin_ means]])
===
> [[Translate clause 5|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 5:
We saw that “bo” בו literally meant with/via/in/on, himself/itself.
===
> [[Translate clause 6|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 6:
We saw that _u’b’shlucho_, ובשלוחו literally means "and/or with/via/in/on his/its shaliach"
===
> [[Translate clause 7|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 7:
So putting that all together, the clause probably should be translated:
> The man produces kiddushin via himself or via his shaliach.
===
> [[Translate clause 8|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 8:
This might be a good time to learn a rule of the Mishnah which hopefully we will get even clearer later on.
===
> [[Translate clause 9|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 9:
The rule is: a “present tense” verb in a Mishnah implies that we are permitted to do the given action “lechatchila” (literally "from the beginning,") ie as a perfectly acceptable option.
- ([[Tangent: Learn about the grammar of the {{present tense}} here]].)
===
> [[Translate clause 10|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 10:
On the other hand, what if the Mishnah were to use a past tense verb, eg “a man produced kiddushin via a shaliach, and it worked”?
===
> [[Translate clause 11|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 11:
So, the past tense version would mean that the given action was “bedieved” (literally, “at the time of later”), ie something that only is acceptable if already done by accident, or in a situation where there are no other options.
===
> [[Translate clause 12|Okay]]
===

Translate clause 12:
So, given that rule, how might we improve our current translation?
> The man produces _kiddushin_ via himself or via his shaliach
===
> [[Translate clause 13|Let me think]]
===

Translate clause 13:
If the present tense implies a “psak” ie legal ruling that something is “mutar lechatchila” ie totally permissible, then we might change our translation to:
> It is perfectly acceptable for the man to produce _kiddushin_ via himself, or via his shaliach.
===
> [[Translate clause 14|Got it]]
===

Translate clause 14:
Great! You can see how we began with a literal translation of the words, ended up with a literal translation of the sentence, and then used rules of language in the Mishnah to improve our translation further.
===
> [[Translate clause 15|Yes]]
===

Translate clause 15:
Great. Now you can continue on to comprehension questions about this clause.
===
> [[#Comprehension Questions]]
===

Comprehension Questions:
Now that we've read the first clause of the Mishnah, let's ask some questions.

Summarize:
When we see a list of options in the Mishnah, does it mean:
- Those options are the only options
- Those options are examples
- Some third way of understanding it?
Stay tuned.
===
> [[#See all comprehension questions|Back to questions]]
===

Comprehension 1-1:
So, we find a list of ways the man can be _mekadesh_, ie himself or with a _shaliach_.
===
> [[Comprehension 1-2|Okay]]
===

Comprehension 1-2:
So, when someone makes a list of options, what might they mean by it?
===
> [[Comprehension 1-3|What?]]
===

Comprehension 1-3:
Let’s use a simpler example. If I send you an invitation to “come drive down to my wedding” – what might I mean by that, practically speaking?
===
> [[Comprehension 1-4|Let me think]]
===

Comprehension 1-4:
Take your time.
===
> [[Comprehension 1-5|I give up]]
===

Comprehension 1-5:
Maybe I mean I am _only_ allowing you to come if you drive.
===
> [[Comprehension 1-6|Right]]
===

Comprehension 1-6:
So, that’s option #1 how to understand a specificity, that I meant it “b’davka”, as the only that way that is acceptable.
===
> [[Comprehension 1-7|Right]]
===

Comprehension 1-7:
Now, what would it mean to interpret a list in the Mishnah this way, as being meant “b’davka?”
===
> [[Comprehension 1-8|What?]]
===

Comprehension 1-8:
We might say such a list would be meant as “exhaustive” – the things on the list would be your only options, and all options would be on the list.
===
> [[Comprehension 1-9|Makes sense]]
===

Comprehension 1-9:
Ok, so, when I said “come drive to my wedding,” what *else* might I have meant besides that you _have_ to drive?
===
> [[Comprehension 1-10|Let me think]]
===

Comprehension 1-10:
Take your time.
===
> [[Comprehension 1-11|I give up]]
===

Comprehension 1-11:
Well, maybe I just meant you _can_ drive, as an example.
===
> [[Comprehension 1-12|Right]]
===

Comprehension 1-12:
So now, ask yourself, how should we understand a list in the Mishnah?
- Should we understand it as an _exhaustive_ list, and there are no other options?
- Or, should we understand it as an _illustrative_ list, and there may be other options also?
- Could there be more options than those two?
===
> [[Comprehension 1-13|Good question]]
===

Comprehension 1-13:
Indeed! Hold that thought, and we'll check back in later to see what the Gemara seems to think about it.

“The” man:
The Mishnah begins with the word _ha’ish_, האיש, which we translated as “the man.”
===
> [[Comprehension 2-2|Okay]]
===

Comprehension 2-2:
But, we saw that in context, the Mishnah is teaching a rule that applies to all men.
===
> [[Comprehension 2-3|Okay]]
===

Comprehension 2-3:
So why doesn’t the Mishnah say _ish mekadesh bo u’bshlucho_ “איש מקדש בו ובשלוחו,” _a_ man may _mekadesh_ himself or with a _shaliach_?
- (Tangent: You can learn more about [[the word “a” ie the {{indefinite article}}]].)
===
> [[Comprehension 2-4|Okay]]
===

Comprehension 2-4:
Or, it could say _anashim mekadshim_, (אנשים מקשים) _men_ may be _mekadesh_ in these two ways.
===
> [[Comprehension 2-5|Okay]]
===

Comprehension 2-5:
Or, it could have just said _mekadshim banu u'b'shlucheinu_, (מקדשים בנו ובשלוחינו) “we” are _mekadesh_, either via ourselves and via our _shluchim_.
===
> [[Comprehension 2-6|Okay]]

How can we understand the specificity of the Mishnah?
When the Mishnah gives a list of things, is that generally davka, lav davka, or the biggest chiddush and kol shekain all less-surprising examples?

What would I have thought in the absence of this Mishnah?

- Introduce the idea of there being three types of specificity, but leave it ambiguous until the Gemara which kind the Gemara thinks the Mishnah is.

What if it hadn't said בו?

What would I have thought if it didn’t say ובשלוחו?

Whose opinion are we trying to figure out?
Is there someone whose mind we could read to see if R Yosef is correct about what he is saying? (Getting the student to recognize that this is a machlochus over the intent of the tana, not stam over what the halacha is.)
