Step three for האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו:
On the second pass, let’s look at the first clause of the Mishnah:
< האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו
===
> [[Step two for האיש מקדש בו ובשלוחו|Remind me what the words mean]]
> [[Help me guess the question]]
===

Help me guess the question:
This clause of the Mishnah teaches that a man can be _mekadesh_ a woman either himself or with a messenger.
===
> [[Hints 2|Ok]]
===

Hints 2: What questions might you have on the Mishnah teaching that?
===
> [[Hints 3|Not sure]]
===

Hints 3: Let’s remember that the Mishnah is the first written encapsulation of the Oral Torah.
===
> [[Hints 4|Ok]]
===

Hints 4: And, let’s remember that  is the oral explanations of the the written Torah.
===
> [[Hints 5|Ok]]
===

Hints 5: Now what does it mean for Oral Torah to be an explanation of written Torah?
===
> [[Hints 6|What does it mean?]]
===

Hints 6: Well, if Oral Torah is an explanation of written Torah, then we might expect every statement of Oral Torah to relate to something mentioned in the written Torah.
===
> [[Hints 7|Makes sense]]
===

Hints 7: So let’s think:
- We have a Mishnah teaching that a man can be _mekadesh_ a woman himself or with messenger
- We know that the Mishnah is the encoding of the Oral Torah
- We know that the Oral Torah is an explanation of the written Torah
Now, what question might we have on this Mishnah?
===
> [[Hints 8|What question?]]
===

Hints 8: If the Mishnah is Oral Torah, and the Oral Torah is an explanation of the written Torah, and we have a ruling in the Mishnah that a man can be _mekadesh_ with a _shaliach_, we might ask where in the written Torah we find a mention of the concept of _shlichus_.
===
> [[Hints 9|That's a good question]]
===

Hints 9: Well, is it a actually good question? Doesn't it just mean that you don't know where psukim are in chumash?
===
> [[Hints 10|Fair point]]
===

Hints 10: Now, what if I told you there was no obvious verse in chumash teaching the din of shlichus?
===
> [[Hints 11|Interesting]]
===

Hints 11: _Now_, maybe we have a good question:
- If the Mishnah is an encapsulation of Oral Torah, and Oral Torah is an explanation on written Torah, how can our Mishnah teach that a man can use a shaliach if there's no obvious verse mentioning that idea?
===
> [[Hints 12|Just like I said]]
===

Hints 12: Congrats! 🎉🎉🎉
- Lastly, let’s see if we can think what categories of answer are possible
===
> [[Hints 13|Okay]]
===

Hints 13: So, the difficulty is:
- Mishnayos generally teach Oral Torah
- We expect statements in Oral Torah to be related to things in the written Torah
- But we don't find a pasuk speaking about shlichus.
===
> [[Hints 14|That _is_ difficult]]
===

Hints 14: So, which of those assumptions can we go away from in order to avoid the difficulty?
===
> [[Hints 15|Which ones?]]
===

Hints 15: Well, we have a few choices.
- We can change our belief that the Mishnah is primarily Oral Torah
- We can change our expectation that every statement of Oral Torah should correspond to something in written Torah
- We can change our expectation that the psukim that mention shlichus should be explicit
===
> [[Hints 16|All good options]]
===

Hints 16: Indeed! So which of those three categories do you think will be the answer?
===
> [[Hints 17|I'm thinking]]
===

Hints 17: Good! Hold that thought and we'll revisit the topic down the road.
