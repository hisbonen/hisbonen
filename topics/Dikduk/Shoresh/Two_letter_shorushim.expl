Two letter shorushim: Generally shorushim in Hebrew and Aramaic have three letters, like קדש. However, some do not have three visible strong letters. Different approaches exist for naming these shorushim, either considering them two letters, or considering there to be a third weak letter like ה/ו/י that sometimes drops.
