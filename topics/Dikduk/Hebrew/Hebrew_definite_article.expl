Hebrew definite article: Hebrew has something called a “definite article,” as do many languages.
The definite article in English is the word “the.”
Definite articles are used to refer to specific things that are already known to the reader.

In Hebrew, the definite article is a ה-prefix before a noun, usually pronounced הַ, _ha_, such as in הַכֶּלֶב, _hakelev_, “the dog.”
The term in Hebrew for “definite article” is ה"א הַיְּדִיעָה, _hay hayediah_, literally “the hay of knowledge,” i.e. because it is used to refer to something that is already known to the reader.
Sometimes, the הַ gets combined with [[the {{prefix ב}}]] or [[the {{prefix ל}}]], and becomes a בַ or לַ, meaning e.g. “in the” or “to the.” For example, adding ב before הַבַּיִת (_habayis_, “the house”) becomes בַּבַּיִת (_babayis_ “in the house,” as opposed to _b’bayis_, “in a house.”)
Aramaic also has a definite article, but it is an א-suffix not a ה-prefix, as in עָלְמָ*א* (_alma,_ “the world.”) <small>{{[[Aramaic definite article|→]]}}</small>
Hebrew and Aramaic have no word like the English “a” to indicate an “indefinite article,” i.e. a generic entity like “a dog.” Rather, nouns that have no definite article are presumed indefinite, so כֶּלֶב, “dog” can also be translated as “a dog.” <small>{{[[Indefinite Article|→]]}}</small>
