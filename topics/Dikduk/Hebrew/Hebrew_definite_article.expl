Hebrew definite article: The Hebrew definite article is a grammatical entity in the Hebrew language.
- Most languages have a concept called [[the {{definite article}}]].
- In Hebrew, the definite article is a ה prefix before a noun, usually pronounced הַ, _ha_.
- The term in traditional grammar for the Hebrew definite article is the ה"א הידיעה, _hay hayediah_, literally the ה of knowledge ie because it indicates we are speaking about an already-known entity.
- Sometimes, the הַ gets combined with [[the {{prefix ב}}]] or [[the {{prefix ל}}]] and becomes a בַ or לַ.
- Aramaic also has a [[Aramaic {definite article}]], but it is an א suffix, like עָלְמָא (_alma,_ “the world”)
