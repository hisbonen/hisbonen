Hebrew definite article: Hebrew has an entity called a [[definite article]], as do many languages.
Definite articles are used to refer to things that are already known to the reader.
In Hebrew, the definite article presents as a ה-prefix before a noun, usually pronounced הַ, _ha_, e.g. as in הַכֶּלֶב, _hakelev_, “the dog.”
The term in Hebrew for “definite article” is ה"א הַיְּדִיעָה, _hay hayediah_, literally “the hay of knowledge,” i.e. because it is used to refer to something that is already known to the reader.
Sometimes, the הַ gets combined with [[the {{prefix ב}}]] or [[the {{prefix ל}}]], and becomes a בַ or לַ, meaning “in the” or “to the,” e.g. adding ב before הַבַּיִת becoming בַּבַּיִת, “in the house.”
Aramaic also has a [[Aramaic {definite article}]], but it is an א-suffix not a ה-prefix, as in עָלְמָא (_alma,_ “the world”)
