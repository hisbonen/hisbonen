Verb forms beginning with ה:
There are several verb forms in Hebrew that begin with a ה prefix:
- The [[{hifil past tense}]] (e.g., הִבְדִּיל, _hivdil,_ “he separated.”)
- The [[{hifil imperative}]] (e.g., הַבְדֵּל, _havdeil,_ “separate!”)
There are no major forms in Aramaic that begin with ה because the Aramaic equivalent of the hifil ie [[afel]] begins with א instead.
