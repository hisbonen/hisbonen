Prefix ד: Aramaic has a prefix ד, meaning “that,” “of,” “who,” or “because.”
- For example:
  - דנטל would mean “that he took” as in “I’m glad that he took.”
  - אמירא דרבא, _amira d’Rava_, “the statement of Rava” 
  - ההוא דנטל _hahu d’natal_, “that one who took”
  - דאמר רב _d’amar Rav_, for/because said Rav
- Sometimes ד is used as a shorthand for something belonging to someone. E.g, “I want ד-רבא”, I want _that of_ Rava i.e. that thing he has.
- The Aramaic prefix ד corresponds to the [[Hebrew prefix ש]].
