Aramaic definite article:
Aramaic has something called a [[definite article]].
Definite articles are added to nouns to indicate the thing is already known to the reader.
In Aramaic, the definite article is an א suffix after a noun, usually vowelized אָ, _au_, such as in עָלְמָא (_aulmau,_ “the world”)
Sometimes Aramaic uses the א suffix in situations that we wouldn’t use the word “the” in English, so we are calling it the definite article here for simplicity.
Hebrew also has a [[Hebrew {definite article}]], but it is a ה-prefix, as in הַמֶלֶךְ (_hamelech,_ “the king.”)
