_Itaf’al_ Imperative: The _itaf’al_ binyan has an [[{{imperative}} form]], which is one of the [[Itaf’al tenses|“tenses” of the _itaf’al_ binyan]].
The [[{{_itaf’al_ imperative}} form]] does not occur frequently enough in the Talmud to determine its regular conjugations. This is the conjugation pattern of the _itaf’al_ in _Targum Onkolos_ for [[regular shorushim]] like מסר:
|            | *Masculine* | *Feminine* |
| *Singular* | אִיתַּפְקַד <br><br> _itafkad!_ <br><br><br> [to a man] <br> be deposited! | אִיתַּפְקַדִי <br><br> _itafkadi!_ <br><br><br> [to a woman] <br> be deposited! |
| *Plural*   | אִיתַּפְקַדוּ <br><br> _itafkadu!_ <br><br><br> [to men] <br> be deposited! | אִיתַּפְקַדָא <br><br> _itafkadau!_ <br><br><br> [to women] <br> be deposited! |
- The _itaf’al_ imperative form corresponds to the [[_hif’il_ imperative]] of Hebrew.
[^1]: Because Aramaic was a less-formal spoken language, it often has several versions of the same word. Parentheses indicate letters that sometimes are omitted.
[^2]: Attempts to vowelize the Gemara are speculative. These conjugations are based on R Yitzchok Frank’s _Grammar for Gemara_.
