_Itaf’al_ Past Tense: The [[{{_itaf’al_}} binyan]] has a [[past tense]], which is one of the [[Itaf’al tenses|“tenses” of the _itaf’al_ binyan]].
The [[_itaf’al_ past tense]] does not occur frequently enough in the Talmud to determine its regular conjugations. This is the conjugation pattern of the _itaf’al_ in _Targum Onkolos_ for [[regular shorushim]] like מסר:
|    \x    | *Singular*                        | \< | *Plural*                            | \< |
| *First- <br> Person* | אִיתַּפְקַדִית <br><br> _itafkadis_ <br><br><br> I was <br> deposited | \< | אִתַּפְקַדְנָא <br><br> _itafkadnau_ <br><br><br> we were<br> deposited | \< |
| *Second-Person* | אִתַּפְקַדְתָּא<br> אִתַּפְקַדְתְּ <br><br> _itafkadtau,<br> itafkadt_ <br><br><br> you [male] <br> were deposited | אִתַּפְקַדְתְּ <br><br> _itafkadt_ <br><br><br> you [female] <br> were deposited | אִתַּפְקַדְתּוּן <br><br> _itafkadtun_ <br><br><br> you [men] were <br> deposited | אִתַּפְקַדְתִּין <br><br> _itafkadtin_ <br><br><br> you [women] were <br> deposited |
| *Third- <br> Person* | ‎אִתַּפְקַד <br><br> _itafkad_ <br><br><br> he was deposited | אִתַּפְקַדַת‎<br><br> _itafkadas_ <br><br><br> she was <br> deposited  | ‎אִתַּפְקַדוּ <br><br> _itafkadu_ <br><br><br> they (men) were deposited | אִתַּפְקַדָא <br><br> _itafkadau_ <br><br><br> they (women) were deposited |
- The _itaf’al_ past tense corresponds to the [[_hif’il_ past tense]] of Hebrew.
[^1]: Because Aramaic was a less-formal spoken language, it often has several versions of the same word. Parentheses indicate letters that sometimes are omitted.
[^2]: Attempts to vowelize the Gemara are speculative. These conjugations are based on R Yitzchok Frank’s _Grammar for Gemara_.
