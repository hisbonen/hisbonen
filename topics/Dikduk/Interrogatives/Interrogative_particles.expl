Interrogative particles:
There are several words and prefixes that can turn a statement into a question.
- These constructs are helpful because traditional Hebrew and Aramaic have no question mark.
- The most common such construct is the Hebrew [[ה interrogative particle]].
- Another example is the [[מי interrogative participle]] which exists in Hebrew and Aramaic.
