ה interrogative particle:
Hebrew has a ה prefix that turns a given sentence into a question.
- In traditional grammar it is called the _hei hashayla_, ה”א השאלה, “question ה.”
- This is not to be confused with the [[Hebrew definite article|Hebrew ה prefix meaning “the”]].
- An example of the _hei hashayla_ would be הֲיֵ֣שׁ לָכֶ֣ם אָ֔ח, _hayesh lechem ach_. Alone, _yesh lechem ach_, יֵ֣שׁ לָכֶ֣ם אָ֔ח would mean “you all have a brother.” With the ה prefix, it means “do you all have a brother?”
- The ה question prefix is usually vowelized as -הֲ, “ha.”
- Sometimes the ה question prefix is found as a standalone word, הַאִם, _ha’im_ which begins a question.
