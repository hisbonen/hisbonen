Construct state:
In many languages there is a way of combining two nouns to produce a combination noun.
- For example, in English I can say something is “The Bank Headquarters” and use “Bank” as an adjective even though it is a noun.
- Common phrases like “post office” and “police station” use this construct form.
- The construct form is called the “smichus” סמיכות in traditional grammar.
- The construct form is contrasted with the absolute form, which is just a regular noun like “the apple.”
