Word-order in Hebrew and Aramaic:
Hebrew and Aramaic have different word-order rules than English:
- In English, you almost always have a subject, then a verb, then an object, eg “The man eats the apple.”
- In Hebrew and Aramaic, these rules are more flexible.
- The existence of the direct object marker את allows the object to precede the subject more easily than in English.
- E.g, את התפוח אוכל האיש, "the apple, the man eats" is perfectly valid Hebrew but is awkward in English.
- Keep a heads up when reading Rishonim like Rashi and Tosofos that sentences frequently begin with a verb or object rather than the subject.
